it's may now. may the force be with you.

i'm really sorry. we lost subject 407. her name is yoon cherry. we lost yoon an hour ago. i'm so sorry. the last vaccine failed. larvae count in her coronary tissue: ~2.1M. Mel was right.

i'm sick of writing lab reports. i'm sick of looking through the glass. i'm sick of being so powerless. i can't remember the last time i cried. i can't cry. i can't escape this sense of suffocating. i didn't look at her face. no, we didn't do our best. we could've destroyed the walls while there was still time. we chose to be pacific. now our people are paying for our sin with their lives.

i'm sorry, again, to share with you these. i hope you understand i need to say things out loud so i can continue our work. please don't tell mel about it. i don't want her to be more sorry. how is she? i didn't have time to catch up with anything out of the lab. i know it'd be selfish to have an unnecessary meeting with her. what i would happily give to hear her voice again, see her face again.

i know you have work to do. unfortunately so do i. please take care. be safe. please tell mel i said hello.
