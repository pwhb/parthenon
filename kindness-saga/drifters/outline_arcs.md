# til the end of the world [drifters]

## I. THE CHILD FROM EDEN

Decades after the heist of free will, P goes to the university where alexandria took place. His research is in Computational Biology. He never stops grieving for K. He never stops showing his true self and his heart because his parents—who he never got to live with—are Revolution and Love. He befriends L, a Microbiology student. Sometimes he sees his mom's ghost in the library asking Strawberry to raise him. He understands his parents' intention: they fought against the horsemen for millennia so their child could grow up in Eden, unprepared for the apocalypse. "We fought so you don't have to."

## II. EMERGENCE

At a deep-sea lithium mining site, a hidden species emerges. Mutated from deep-sea siphonophores, they replace their ancient food source with the human telomeres of exhausted workers. When these workers age decades and die of old age within months, the lavender ghosts have already spread across the world. They become known as Wisteria Drifters (Hadeanema wisteriae). They use their tentacles to embrace humans and lay eggs inside living hosts. Due to their first exposure to humans with high stress hormones, they evolve to target poor populations primarily.

The world experiences a new pandemic: The Lavender Death. Governments worldwide mercilessly restrict the spread when it's too late, bombing entire cities to contain outbreaks. Walls are built to protect the rich—who were never at significant risk—while the oppressed risk their lives through manual labor: farming, manufacturing, and other essential work. Many elites retreat to vaults or space stations.

## III. EVENT HORIZON

With the help of Moir.ai—now advanced for scientific purposes but not for oppressive manipulation or surveillance—researchers predict that the poor, making up 97% of humanity, will be wiped out by the drifters within seven to nine years. P, L, and their mechanic friend T start a disaster relief organization called Event Horizon. Having grown up with Strawberry's heists and his parents' legacy, P wants to tear down the walls to bring justice for Earth's last humans.

Survival now depends on pure luck. The drifters' slow but consistent metabolism means infection risks are initially isolated—either you or your friends are in danger, but not both simultaneously. This will change as their population grows exponentially.

L seeks a cure or coexistence. She shares an apartment with M, a girl from the poor regions now trapped inside the elite safe zone. P, M, L, and T form a team:

P, M, and L work as researchers

T operates as a smuggler in the new logistical nightmare

M falls for T; P despises T's unseriousness. L initially finds P's cynicism repulsive. Eventually, they accept each other and work together for slim hope against the Lavender Death.

## IV. UNRETURNED LOVE

P has watched many loved ones die under his care. As the last survivor from Strawberries Home, he secretly starts Project Pandora—inspired by Strawberry and the knights—to neutralize elite privilege. His goal: to erase the biomarker that shields the rich and finally level the playing field.

Two years post-Emergence, they find the first elite infected in the safe zone. Though risk remains far lower than for the unprotected poor, this proves no one is safe. The drifters may evolve further.

P falls unrequitedly in love with M. She can't reciprocate, burdened by guilt over romance during humanity's crisis. When M sends an elite tissue sample via T, he fails the delivery. Left theorizing blindly, they grasp at straws. P postpones Project Pandora—he can't afford to put M in danger.

## V. SACRIFICE

Three years after Emergence, with no volunteers left, M tests a new vaccine on herself against P and L's warnings. It seems successful—until she contracts the Lavender Death while caring for elite patients. She hides her infection until it's too late, dying in L's arms. Shattered, P quits Event Horizon.

## VI. PROJECT PANDORA

P realizes their wasted years stem from elite resource hoarding. He loads Pandora into wine barrels (nodding to Diogenes, his mother's prophet) and has T distribute it to all elite vaults and space stations.

He knows M wouldn't want vengeance. Strawberry and his parents wouldn't want continued war. He may be dooming humanity. Yet trembling with guilt, he pulls the final lever unapologetically—not for revenge, but as a heist of justice. He believes in the poor's survival chances if freed from elite obstruction.

## VII. ALEXANDRIA

Elites panic as their privileges vanish. In spite, they launch nuclear attacks on random targets. The convocation hall—which the Professor failed to burn—is now reduced to ash.

P and L work separately on solutions while T supports L. P never stops grieving K and M, nor absolving himself of guilt. He often talks to the ghosts of K and M. He spends his remaining years working alone, reading the Tao Te Ching that K returned.
