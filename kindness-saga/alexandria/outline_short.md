# we met in alexandria [alexandria]

A student-narrator drifts between dream and waking life, haunted by grief, guilt, and the residue of an academic world he’s fled. The book opens in a surreal classroom where a ceiling fan detaches and decapitates headless classmates who continue photographing the blackboard; the narrator, bound to his chair, cuts himself and passes through the blackboard into an identical room—an early taste of the looping nightmare that frames his experience.

An alarm repeatedly pulls him between dream and reality. He wakes alone, sips rum, and performs domestic rituals with an anxious, purposeless precision: leaving the house, returning to check trivial things, boarding a bus. The alarm is revealed to be for a weekly therapy appointment with a psychology professor who works at Atlas University—the narrator is now a dropout. He sees his deceased lover in passing and reports hallucinations to his therapist, who probes isolation, money he received from his lover’s family, and a recent bookstore visit the narrator can’t fully recall.

Aimless, he wanders back toward campus and fights a panic attack. A young, anarchist professor now teaches in his old mentor’s place—declaring he's against rules, sharing libgen links, and favoring a bookstore called Alexandria where students resell textbooks. This young professor’s tone and gestures echo the narrator’s old mentor and spark both nostalgia and disorientation. In the class, the narrator notices a student that challenges the professor demanding rigorousness and a strong girl obsessed with pink defending the professor. The narrator obsessively texts his dead lover about these encounters.

He drifts to Guillotine, a bar from his past, where he’s confronted with loneliness and a casual philosophic parable the professor offers: two men, Adam (empathetic, unlucky) and Ben (strategic, entitled), and which kind benefits society more. The narrator wants more Adams in the world but confesses he is tired of being one—he mourns his lover and fears losing everything he loves.

At the bookstore he once visited often with his lover, he sees the pink girl asks about two versions of an Anarchist Cookbook; the narrator recognizes in her flashes of his old academic life and the mentor who used to hand out books. He continues to dissociate in therapy, and learns that his old professor (a friend of his therapist) has been hospitalized—news that hits him like a physical wound. He revisits the hospital but turns away, unable to face the past and the memory of reading Dostoevsky aloud to his comatose lover.

Back in the therapist’s office he admits guilt and failure. The therapist encourages contact; the narrator retreats instead to his old professor’s office, finding the young professor among scattered books and two black books that resemble Anarchist Cookbooks. He follows the young professor to attend the classroom he never enrolled in, watching the same hostile student and the same defender in pink. Deja vu tightens around him.

He eats in the canteen where he once shared beef ramen with his lover; the pink girl acknowledges him with a small bow. The narrator repeatedly tries—and fails—to resign formally from the university, his old professor refusing to accept his resignation and offering continuing support. His lover pleads that he endure school for love and stability; he resists, railing against institutional rites and promising he won’t be branded by graduation. The narrator has a nightmare about him choosing not to take the exam as it's the only way out of the academic prison.

In therapy he admits he wants to make food—Burmese tofu—for comrades. He wanders, smokes, and notices the pink girl again with the black cookbooks; he recalls he once owned copies, and that his lover hated them. Attempting to cook is a fragile tether to the living: his early batches of tofu fail as he clings to ritual. He reads that a medical lab was burglarized—the lab he frequented when his lover was hospitalized—and feels a perverse satisfaction at the injustice done to staff who had treated him poorly.

A call from his therapist reveals his old professor has died. He attends the funeral in a carefully dressed grief, spots the pink girl among mourners (hinting she may be the professor’s daughter), and is reassured by his therapist that his professor had spoken of him often. The narrative folds back into nightmare: he wanders an endless morgue corridor, desperate to see his mentor’s body. Confronting what he believes to be his lover’s corpse, he pours out apologies—about reading her the books she hated—and then jolts awake as her eyes snap open, plunging him again between nightmare and waking.

The narrator’s grip on reality frays: nights of compulsive chess and waking to chess-piece heads bleeding into his perceptions symbolize mounting dissociation. He confesses his dream to his therapist, who urges steadiness, while campus life itself begins to morph—students and acquaintances take on chess-piece features, literal and grotesque. He notices the student that demands rigorousness with a knight head.

At Guillotine the narrator reconnects with the pink girl; they share fragile intimacies after a night of heavy drinking. He blacks out and later learns from the young professor that she and the professor helped get him home. The professor gives him a copy of the Tao Te Ching, a token that triggers memories and questions.

Weeks pass; the pink girl vanishes from class, leaving the narrator anxious and remorseful. He stalks familiar haunts and finds himself ignored by apparitions of the professor and his lover that should be dead—reinforcing his sense of being a ghost. In another dream he rehearses a lecture and experiences a vivid erotic fantasy with the pink girl that collapses into horror when his lover appears in the glass’s reflection.

Confronting the young professor after a panic attack, the narrator uncovers tangled intimacies and confessions: the professor admits to fantasies and hypocrisy but claims he never acted on them. The narrator reveals a deeper truth—he and the professor may be the same person. Discovering keys and a locked laptop profile, he accesses lecture notes and messages that show overlapping identities and confirms his lover is alive. A conversation with his therapist reframes the crisis as an invitation to reconcile with himself.

A cautious rapprochement with the lover follows: they meet for lunch at a canteen in the NexBank she works at; she’s involved with a banker fiancé and blames him for loving anti-system ideology more than her. Both men—narrator and professor—accept a fragile peace; they walk home together, shadows merging.

The narrator’s despair crescendos into radical action: he asks the professor for help to erase institutional records. Given access, he breaches systems and prepares an elaborate plan—an evacuation via fake bomb threat, a real explosive hidden to destroy physical convocation records, and scripts to wipe digital data. Before he acts, the pink girl returns two resignation letters and his copy of the Tao Te Ching; he gives her the book instead. He sets the plan in motion, pulls the alarm, executes the data wipe, and detonates the hall—literally burning the institutional archive he loathes while embracing the role of arsonist in service of his ideological rupture.
