# we met in alexandria [alexandria]

A student-narrator drifts between dream and waking life, haunted by grief, guilt, and the residue of an academic world he’s fled. The book opens in a surreal classroom: a ceiling fan detaches and decapitates classmates who continue photographing the blackboard. Bound to his chair, the narrator cuts himself and passes through the blackboard into an identical room—an early taste of the looping nightmare that will frame his days.

Recurring alarms pull him between dream and reality. He wakes, sips rum, and performs domestic rituals with anxious, purposeless precision—leaving the house, returning to check trivial things, boarding a bus. The alarm is for a weekly therapy appointment with a psychology professor at Atlas University: the narrator is now a dropout. He glimpses his deceased lover in passing—always ghostlike—and reports hallucinations to his therapist, who probes his isolation, the monthly support he withdrew from his lover’s family, and a recent bookstore visit the narrator can’t fully recall.

Aimless, he wanders back to campus and is overwhelmed by a panic attack. A young, anarchic professor now occupies his old mentor’s chair—declaring “no rules,” sharing LibGen links, and praising a bookstore called Alexandria where students resell textbooks. The young professor’s manner echoes the narrator’s old mentor and stirs both nostalgia and disorientation. In lectures the narrator notices a combative student demanding rigor and a fiercely loyal girl obsessed with pink defending the professor. He compulsively texts his dead lover about these encounters.

At Guillotine, the bar they once frequented, the professor offers a parable about Adam (empathetic, unlucky) and Ben (strategic, entitled) that crystallizes the narrator’s ambivalence: he admires Adam’s humanity yet resents the costs of being one. Loneliness and grief press on him.

In the Alexandria bookstore he once visited with his lover, the pink girl asks about two versions of an Anarchist Cookbook—an echo of the mentor who used to hand out books. Dissociative therapy sessions follow; then the narrator learns his old professor has been hospitalized. He cannot face the hospital—memories of reading Dostoevsky aloud to his lover in a coma make him turn away.

Back in the therapist’s office he admits guilt and failure. Told to reconnect, he instead drifts to his old professor’s office and finds the young professor amid scattered books and two black cookbooks. He follows the professor into the unregistered classroom, experiencing growing deja vu: the same hostile student, the same defender in pink.

In the canteen where he once shared beef ramen, the pink girl acknowledges him with a small bow. Repeated attempts to resign from the university fail—his old professor refuses and offers support. His lover—always spectral—pleads in memory that he endure; he refuses, railing against rites like graduation. Nightmares about choosing not to take the exam underscore his sense of escape and imprisonment.

Therapy surfaces a different hunger: he wants to make Burmese tofu for comrades. This domestic project anchors him briefly. He notices the pink girl again, carrying the black cookbooks—remembering he once owned copies and that his lover despised them. Research about a burglary at the medical lab he frequented gives him a grim satisfaction against staff who treated him poorly. He tries making tofu; the batches fail, and ritual frays.

A call from his therapist delivers blunt news: his old professor has died. At the funeral he sees the pink girl among mourners—an image that suggests she is the old mentor’s daughter—and the therapist comforts him, saying the professor often mentioned him. Nightmare returns: an endless morgue corridor, a desperate attempt to see his mentor’s body, and a transient, ghostly reunion with his deceased lover that jolts him awake.

Reality unravels further. Nights of compulsive chess melt into waking hallucinations: chess-piece heads bleed into people’s faces, turning campus into a grotesque board. He reports this to his therapist. The rigorous student now appears with a knight’s head—metaphor made flesh.

At Guillotine, he drinks with the pink girl and the young professor. Later, in the restroom after too many drinks, the pink girl kneels beside him while he vomits; she wipes his lips, caresses his face, and kisses him—strawberry on her lips. He blacks out. When he wakes, he asks the professor what happened. The professor says the pink girl and he carried him out and got him home, then gives him a copy of the Tao Te Ching.

Weeks pass. The pink girl vanishes from class, leaving him anxious and remorseful. He haunts bookshop and campus, increasingly feeling like a ghost—ignored by apparitions of the professor and his deceased lover. In a dream-rehearsal of a lecture an erotic fantasy with the pink girl collapses into horror when his lover appears in the glass’s reflection—guilt and desire collapsing together. These slippages build toward a break: he begins reading the Tao Te Ching and recognizes his lover’s handwriting in the inscription. Driven by suspicion, the narrator then lays out what he’s found: unfamiliar keys, a locked laptop, and the Tao-triggered memory. He uses a password—wemetinalexandria—to unlock a profile that contains lecture notes in his handwriting, faculty emails, and messages proving overlapping identities and that his lover is in fact alive (explaining her spectral presence in his life). 

Confirmed that he and the young professor are the same person, he calls his therapist for guidance. The therapist advises caution and helps him brace for the discovery. Only after speaking with his therapist does he confront the young professor whose office he can open with his keys now. In that meeting the professor admits fantasies and hypocrisy but insists he never acted on them; he confesses affection for the pink girl and shame about his impulses. Convinced by his other self, the narrator forgives him eventually and requests to see his resurrected lover.

A tentative meeting with the lover follows at the NexBank canteen where she now works. She has a banker fiancé and says bluntly, “You love hating the system more than you love me.” He replies that railing against the system is his only skill. Their reunion is sober—she still cares, but they can’t reconcile fully. The narrator and the professor—two halves—walk home together, shadows merging.

The narrator asks the professor for system access; the professor, seeking penance, helps. He breaches admin systems, writes destructive scripts and prepares an explosive device with a calculated plan: a fake bomb threat to evacuate the convocation hall, an actual charge hidden to destroy the building’s physical archives, and a timed script to wipe digital records once people are clear. Before he departs, the pink girl returns two resignation letters and the black cookbooks; the narrator gives her the Tao Te Ching back, telling her to be kind.

He executes the plan: pulls the fire alarm, triggers the data-wipe script in the panic, and detonates the device—destroying convocation’s physical records and his own last institutional ties. The book ends ambiguously on consequence and meaning: whether he achieved justice, committed an atrocity, or simply enacted a private apocalypse is left for the reader, but the narrator has irrevocably crossed from dissociation into decisive, violent action.
