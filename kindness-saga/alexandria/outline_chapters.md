## I. the ceiling fan (tartarus)

the narrator sees his professor in a blurred vision. he's stuck in a surreal classroom. he can't understand his caring professor, "are you okay?" his classmates are sitting in the opposite direction. the ceiling fan is dropped from the ceiling and cut the classmates' head. they still take pictures of the blackboard even though they lost heads. the narrator finds himself to be tied to the chair and he cuts himself trying to break free. when he runs into the blackboard because he finds no door, he enters the blackboard and finds himself in another classroom. the narrator sees his professor in a blurred vision.

---

## II. the alarm (morpheus)

an alarm wakes up the narrator from a dream. he's still not sure he's in a dream. he drinks a finger of rum in the glass on a chair beside his bed. he does normal chores. purposelessly he finds himself preparing to go to school even without knowing what class he's taking. he finds himself going back to home a couple times for various reasons; checking if he locked the door, forgetting to brush teeth, forgetting the lighter. he gets on a bus at last. an alarm wakes up the narrator from a dream.

---

## III. the ghost (melinoe)

he realizes the alarm is for his weekly therapy session with his therapist, a psychology professor in the campus, his old university, Atlas University. he also realizes he's a dropout now. he sees his deceased lover on the way. he sees his therapist in a classroom. he mentions about hallucinating his lover. the therapist asks him if the library of alexandria is still burning. he shows he feels like the academic institution should be destroyed to free curiosity of the students. the therapist asks him if he's talked to anyone recently because he delete all social media apps. he answers he has no contact with anyone. suddenly he remembers he recently visited the bookstore but can't remember why. he dissociates during the session and sees his lover in the university library.

---

## IV. the young professor (prometheus)

after the therapy, he finds himself walking towards his old classroom purposelessly. he has a panic attack because it's so overwhelming to revisit the place he ran away from years ago. during the panic attack, he notices a young professor in his old classroom. "the only rule in this classroom is that there's no rule because rules are the enemies of studying." the narrator notices a student that mercilessly criticizes the professor's speech. he also notices another student that's obsessed with color pink defending the awkward professor. the professor shares lib gen links and teaches them how to pirate textbooks. he also mentions that there's a bookstore he likes called "Alexandria" where students from Atlas University resell their textbooks after each year. [I'll add a lecture scene here that's relavent to the anarchist spirit of the story] the young professor reminds him about his old mentor. the narrator texts his lover about the strange professor, fully knowing she'll never receive his messages.

---

## V. the bar

the narrator finds himself visiting the bar called "Guillotine", he used to frequent. now that he's a dropout, he doesn't have a friend to drink together. he figures his old classmates graduated years ago and probably have jobs now. he orders "free-will", a special cocktail available there. after a visit to toilet; they have two toilets, one is labeled "female" and another "other", he finds the professor sitting besides his seat at the counter. he orders "lavender tears", the signature drink of the bar. the professor smiles to him and starts talking to him. it's the first non-therapy he has in years. the professor tells him the paradox about two people, Adam and Ben. Adam is kind and untitled. Ben is strategic and entitled. Adam doesn't get anything he wants and loses everything he love. Ben gets what he wants and rarely lose anything he love. Adam understands people. Ben commands people. people feels safe enough to be rude around Adam but they walk on eggshells around Ben. while Adam brings out the worst nature in people, Ben brings out the civilized nature in people. objectively speaking, from whom the society more? the narrator answers he doesn't care whom the society benefits from. Ben benefits more. but he wishes more people like Adam exist. but he doesn't wish to be like Adam. he wouldn't mind being Adam if he can hold just one thing he loves instead of losing all, thinking about his lover.

---

## VI. the bookstore

the narrator visits the bookstore where he used to date with his lover. the student that's obsessed with pink smiles at him. he overhears her asking the shopkeeper if the store has an Anarchist Cookbook. the shopkeeper asks which one; there's two the original and the communal. the girl answers both. the shopkeeper promises her he'll keep them in reserve when he can get them. the narrator doesn't understand why but the girl pink girl reminds him of his old professor. he used to hand out books to faculty members and students. he is lost in thought until the pink girl awkwardly bow a little to show respect to him before leaving the bookstore. does she recognizes him as a senior? he texts his lover about visiting the bookstore.

---

## VII. the old professor

the narrator is dissociating in his therapist's office. the therapist asks why he thinks he went to the bookstore. the narrator feels like it's a dream. it feels like a deja vu. he's not sure but he feels like he saw the bookkeeper keeping the anarchist cookbooks in reserve. can he see the future? the narrator tells the therapist he misses his old professor, who's a friend of the therapist. in fact his old professor recommended him to see the therapist. he doesn't remember how many times he submitted his resignation letter that ended up being rejected by his old professor. the therapist tells him the old professor was hospitalized. Atlas General, he informs him. the narrators mentions he met a strange professor in his old professor's place. he also tells him he's been attending the class. the therapist is glad to hear it. perhaps it might ignite his passion for studies again.

---

## VIII. the hospital

the narrator feels like he's a ghost in the hospital hallway. he's too anxious to ask at the reception for his old professor's room number. he remember visiting his lover here. everything feels so unreal. after an accident, she was in comma and he read her dostoevsky books. he knew she hated them but he wished she woke up to shut him up. he fails to collect courage to ask the reception. in truth, he can't bear to relive losing her. in truth, he can't bear to see the face of his old mentor that he failed. he recalls his mentor is the only one professor that treated him with kindness while everyone else was cruel to him because he was different from others. he turns back from the hospital hallway. he thinks he sees the pink girl at the pharmacy.

---

## IX. the office

the narrator find himself in the therapist's office, since the classroom is locked. the therapist asks him what he felt when he was at the hospital. the narrator answers guilt. the therapist wants to know what kind of guilt. the narrator thinks he failed his professor. he wasn't sure if he has a right to see his professor. the therapist asks him if he saw his lover at the hospital. the narrator shakes his head. the therapist assures his professor would love to see him and would never think for a second that his student failed him or he failed his student. he says he'll tell the professor about him when he visits the hospital and ends the therapy session.

the dropout, having no where to go, goes to his old professor's office. he doesn't have a panic attack this time. he sees the young professor in his old professor's office. he has books opened across the room just like his old professor. he saw two black books that look like Anarchist Cookbook among them. the young professor looks at his watch and then get up. when he comes out of his office, he notices the narrator and smiles at him awkwardly and then close his office door. he subtly nods his head towards the classroom, asking for the narrator to follow him.

---

## X. the classroom

the first thing the narrator notices in the classroom is the pink girl. he doesn't know why but she almost looks like she's smiling at him. he awkwardly takes a seat in the back. he doesn't understand why he is still attending this class he never enrolled for. he didn't even attend his classes when he was a student.

the narrator experiences a deja vu. he notices a student that mercilessly criticizes the professor's lecture. he also notices another student that's obsessed with color pink defending the awkward professor. [I'll add a lecture scene here that's relevant to the anarchist spirit of the story]

---

## XI. the canteen

the narrator goes to the canteen he used to go with his lover. it is crowded. he orders the same beef ramen he used to eat with his lover. he sees the pink girl subtly bows towards him, smiling to show respect, again.

---

## XII. paperwork

the narrator is in his old professor's office. his professor isn't convinced he's financially struggling to continue his studies. but he tells him he'd support him. he refuses to sign the letter. failing to convince his old professor, he left the office. he tells his lover about that. his lover is glad the professor rejected his resignation. she assures she'll always be there to support him.

he finds himself writing another resignation letter. this time the reason is mental illness. his attention disorder is something everyone knows. he asks his old professor to allow him to quit school again. his professor tells him to see his friend, the therapist at the psychology department. he refuses his suggestion. but the professor gives his his friend's number anyway.

---

## XIII. beef ramen

the narrator's lover begs him to study. he says it's meaningless. he says he wants to break free from this absurd academic system. she begs him again and again. she tells him she'll buy him beef ramen everyday. she tells him to study if she loves him. he tells her he loves her but he's not going to take this exam. he tells her he has no choice. his professor will never let him go as long as he doesn't abandon the rules. his lover begs him to endure it until he graduates. he tell her graduation is the ceremony of branding slave marks on your back and he doesn't want a slave mark. after a long fight, he apologizes to her and turn off his phone.

---

## XIV. the cookbooks

the therapists ask the narrator if he knows what he wants other than from things like seeing his lover. the therapist wants him to answer he wants to continue his studies. he thinks about it but he prefers to go to the class he has no obligation to go to. he answers he wants to make food for his comrades even though he doesn't know who his comrades are. what kind of food, the therapist asks. burmese tofu, he answers. why doesn't he make some as a rehearsal, the therapist asks. he says he'll think about it. he used to make tofu for his lover and his friends. it'd be sad to make some tofu without someone to share. the therapist suggests to share it with his old professor. even if he's too sick to have some, his daughter would appreciate it.

missing his old professor, the narrator walks to the young professor's office. he stops on the way to smoke a cigarette. when he reaches the office, he sees the pink girl getting out of it with two black books holding in her arms. she doesn't bow this time. the narrator vaguely recalls her asking about anarchist cookbooks at the bookstore. he realizes the books in her arms are the cookbooks. he doesn't enter the office. he recalls he had his copies of the cookbooks he got from the bookstore too. his lover hated them. especially the original one. he texts his lover about the pink girl. girls these days are reading anarchist cookbooks. he recalls that it's been a while he hasn't seen her.

---

## XV. tofu

it's been a few days since he last saw his therapist. the narrator goes to the grocery store. when he sees chickpea powder, he remembers he wants to make tofu. he forgot how to make it. he remembers he used to write recipes in a document in his laptop. but he can't login to his profile. he tries his lover's name, his lover's birthday, and so on. he tries to access the file from the guest profile. but he fails. he just look up the recipe online and make some tofu. the first batch isn't good. he makes another batch. he wishes he could share it with his lover. while waiting for tofu, he reads in the news that there was a burglary at the medical labs. it's the same one he used to go while his lover was in the hospital. he still has some receipts from there in his wallet. he kept them as something to remember his lover. he's glad that it was stolen. the staff there were too rude. they once gave him wrong labs results. this tofu batch isn't good either. he tries to make another batch.

## XVI. the funeral

the narrator picks up a call from his therapist and learns his old professor passed away. he feels so empty. he dresses himself well and attends his old professor's funeral. he sees the pink girl at the funeral. [I'll add details here to point out that the narrator eventually realizes she's his old mentor's daughter.] he also sees the young professor talking to the pink girl. his therapist approaches him to ask about his well-being. the narrator sorrowfully confesses he wishes he visited his old professor. the therapist tries to comfort him saying his friend was unconscious when he visited the hospital. he tells him he mentioned about the narrator. perhaps the old professor understands him.

---

## XVII. the hallway

the narrator finds himself in the hallway walking to the morgue. he doesn't understand why the hallway is endless or why he's trying to see the body of his mentor whose funeral he already attended. [this is a nightmare sequence just like the first chapter.] he used to be mad at his old mentor for rejecting his resignation again and again. he wants to apologize for it. he sees his lover's body being taken out of the morgue. he tries to stop the strangers pushing the body. he caress his lover's face. he apologizes to her for reading dostoevsky because it was the only books that help him with his anxiety. he apologizes again and again. he confesses he wished he read her jane austen instead. he sees his lover's eyes open and then he wakes up.

---

## XVIII. king's gambit

the narrator realizes he's getting unstable again. it's two past midnight. he keeps playing chess to stay awake. he keeps losing. when he remembers to look at the time, it's already morning. he gets up and goes to see his therapist. he retells him about his dream. the therapist tells him it's normal to be unstable again when the old wounds are reopened. he has to understand that the only thing he can do now is to live in the memory of his lover and his professor and live in a way that would make them proud of him. he sees his therapist has a bishop head. he's seeing chess patterns everywhere.

he wants to text his lover. but he doesn't, overwhelmed by his guilt and sorrow. he see the student that demands rigorousness from the professor in the campus. he has a knight (horse) head.

---

## XIX. the restroom

the narrator goes to the "Guillotine" bar after class. the nostalgia is agonizing. he misses his friends. he misses playing dart with his friends. he remembers pretending to play billiards with his friends only using two balls making other people impatiently wait. he's summoned to the present when the pink girl takes the seat at his table. she orders "blood of eden" cocktail. he politely asks her how she's doing. she confesses she feels lost without her dad. he lost his dad when he was about her age too. but he didn't mention about it because he was relieve when his dad passed away because he was abusive to him all his life. she's just like him. alone and lost. she tells him about her classes. after a while, she excuses herself and take a visit to the restroom. he notices she enters "other" bathroom. after a while, the young professor enters the bar and asks him for a seat at the table. he orders "lavender tears" again. when the pink girl comes out of the restroom, she's not surprised to see her professor at the table. she smiles at both and continue talking about her classes. she lights a cigarette. she also expresses her opinion about that student that demands rigorousness in every class. he's exhausting. the professor says he doesn't really mind. he's even grateful that he's there to correct him.

the singer is singing "Apocalypse" by "Cigarettes After Sex" when the narrator realizes he doesn't remember how much he drunk. chilling with nostalgia, he rushed to the restroom. he finds his head in the toilet bowl, vomiting. he feels someone patting his back to help him. he couldn't look back. when he finishes vomiting, he sits down on the floor. he sees the pink girl caressing his back. she delicately wipe his lips, smiling at him. she tells him that he looks like her dad when he was young. she makes a joke that they could be brother and sister. he smiles at her. she caresses his face and tries to kiss his forehead and then his cheek. awkwardly she kisses his lips too. her kiss tastes like strawberry. he neither kisses her back or pushes her. he doesn't understand why he's still hearing the song. he doesn't remember if he passed out.

---

## XX. library

the narrator wakes up at the library. he's not sure if he dreamed about kissing the pink girl. he feels guilty the same. he goes to the professor's office. he might know what happened as he's the only one that was present there. the professor is taking a nap on his desk. he knocks on the door to wake him up and the professor welcomes him. he says he's sorry but he wants to know if they drunk yesterday. the professor nods. the narrator tells him he can't remember what happened. the professor explains he passed out in the restroom. the girl asked him for help and he carried him. they tried to wake him up. it took them a while to wake him up. they got a taxi for him and they wished he got home safely. when he's about to leave the office, the professor asks him to wait and gives him a copy of tao te ching.

---

## XXI. spectator mode

it's been a while he last saw the pink girl. he doesn't know how to or why but he wants to apologize to her. the debates in the classrooms are mostly one-sided since she's been skipping classes. maybe she's avoiding him. maybe she's dealing with her grief. he feels like she sucked the despair from him. of course it didn't make him feel better. it'd be so awkward to see her again but he wants to see her again. the professor should be as clueless as him.

he visits the bookstore hoping he might find her. instead he sees the professor and his lover laughing. he doesn't understand why they don't see him. he tries to awkwardly talk to them. even though his lover should be a ghost, they are treating him as a ghost. he even tries to scream but they still can't hear him. it's so suffocating. he just assumes it's a dream and he'll wake up eventually.

---

## XXII. the window glass

the narrator likes to pretend to teach the class when all classes are over. his professor once said he used to practice like that too. he can see his reflection in the window glass. [insert a mock lecture to rehearse. but it's not serious because this is a dream sequence again.]

when he looks at the class, he sees the pink girl clapping. she's smiling at him. she slowly and seductively approaches him. he doesn't know why he hugs her waist and caresses her face. she's so different from his lover. but he finds her beautiful. she leans towards him and kiss him. he knows it's wrong but he fails to resist. he's too thirsty for intimacy. he takes her clothes off. she pulls his pants down. he starts having sex with her on the desk. he can see his face in the window glass. he doesn't understand why but his face isn't his. it's the young professor's. he's so confused. is he fantasizing that he's the young professor who's having sex with his student, his mentor's daughter. he focuses on the window glass and suddenly he sees someone behind the glass. he stops fucking the pink girl and goes to the glass quickly. he sees his lover, looking mad at him.

---

## XXIII. the book

the narrator wakes up with a panic attack. when he can ground himself, he has to conclude the young professor isn't normal. he remembers he gives him tao te ching. he feels like it's more than a book. he doesn't understand why he sense his lover's warmth when he thinks about it. he opens the book and sees his lover's handwriting on the first page. "we met in alexandria". why does the professor have this book? did he give this book to him to humiliate him? determined to confront with him, he thinks about how to ask him. he tries to read tao te ching. he slowly remembers his lover gives it to him as a gift. then why does the professor has it? he remembers reading dostoevsky's the double. it's almost like the professor is his junior. he tries to consider if it's possible that he's the professor. he carefully looks into his bag and he finds some keys he doesn't recognize. it might be the professor's office key. all he has to do is to go to the office in the morning and check if one of those keys can open the office. but isn't there something else that requires a key? he remembers the profile in his laptop. he tries "wemetinalexandria" and it's unlocked. he looks into his profile. he finds lecture notes he wrote. he finds his faculty emails. he finds his social media accounts in the browser. he finds he's been in contact with his lover. he scroll through his lover's profile. she's still very alive. he remembers she definitely had an accident; she had a trip with her classmates soon after he chose to not take his exam. she'd been in coma. he texts her, "when is the last time we met?" she replies, "at the bookstore". he realizes what he saw at the bookstore wasn't a dream. he was there as the professor. the professor locked him out so he can't make them notice him.

he calls his therapist in the morning. he realizes his therapist knew the professor is himself. he asks him if it's possible to talk to himself. the therapist retraces how he figures it out. he explains he begins to suspect it because of the book. he got it at the professor's office. the therapist suggests him to go to the professor's office. the therapist warns him to be very gentle with himself. just like the narrator isn't aware that the professor is himself, the professor might not be aware that he's the narrator. learn to understand yourself and accept yourself, the therapists advises.

## XXIV. face-off

the narrator can easily open the professor's office. he sits in the guest's chair and wait for him. after a while, the professor enters the room and is surprised to see him. "is there anything I can help you with?" the narrator nods. he asks him why he gave him tao te ching. he answers it's a habbit he got from his old professor. he asks him if his old professor also hands out his lover's gift to any random person. the professor opens the book and sees "we met in alexandria". the professor is surprised by how the narrator knows about his lover. he quietly replies she's his former lover and asks how he knew it was his former lover's gift. the narrator is angry and asks him if the student girl is his lover now. the professor answers no. the narrator asks him to be honest and if he knows something about being physically intimate with the student girl in the classroom. the professor shamefully answers he had a wet dream like that and he felt guilty about it but there's nothing complicated between him and the girl. he's shocked by how the narrator knows about his dream. the narrator interrogates him if he took advantage of his student. the professor says he worked for sexual harassment policy when he was a student. the narrator points out that it doesn't mean he's not a hypocrite. the professor confessed he had some feelings about his student. he recognizes he's a hypocrite. he confesses he wanted to be physically intimate with her. but he never approached her. because he wants to save her from him. the narrator is finally convinced and tells him he and the professor are the same person. the professor asks him how he sent himself home with a taxi. the narrator answers they both might have been on the taxi or they both were with the girl. only the girl knows. the professor assured him he stayed away from the former lover to protect her too. the narrator asked him how his former lover is alive. the professor answers she never died. she just broke up with him when she recovered. he accepted it and wasted a year, since he failed the exam, drowning in alcohol. it was a confusing year for him too. while the narrator clings onto the therapy, the professor clings onto the normal status quo.

they both goes home together for the first time.

## XXV.

the narrator asks for help from the professor. he wants to destroy the convocation hall and destroy student data. the professor, wanting to redeem for his shameful sins, gives him his access. the narrator phishes the university admins and he gains access to delete student data. before he starts deleting he make a bomb to blow up the hall. he makes a plan to evacuate the people insides the building with a fake timebomb and then actually blow it up when everyone is safe.

when the narrator goes to the professor's office to say goodbye, he sees the pink girl at the front. she hands him two resignation letters, hers and the logical student. they are friends now. she also returns the cookbooks but he doesn't take them back. he also gives her the copy of tao te ching. he signs their resignation letters and tell her to be kind. she bows towards him again. the narrator enters the covocation hall and plants the fake bomb and the actual bomb. he pull the alarm to evacuate people in the building. he pretends to run along those people. he runs a script to delete the digital records. when people are at a safe distance he blow up the building, destroying the physical records.
