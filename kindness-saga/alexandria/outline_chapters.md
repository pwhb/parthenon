## IV. the young professor (prometheus)

after the therapy, he finds himself walking towards his old classroom purposelessly. he has a panic attack because it's so overwhelming to revisit the place he ran away from years ago. during the panic attack, he notices a young professor in his old classroom. "the only rule in this classroom is that there's no rule because rules are the enemies of studying." the narrator notices a student that mercilessly criticizes the professor's speech. he also notices another student that's obsessed with color pink defending the awkward professor. the professor shares lib gen links and teaches them how to pirate textbooks. he also mentions that there's a bookstore he likes called "Alexandria" where students from Atlas University resell their textbooks after each year. the narrator texts his lover about the strange professor, fully knowing she'll never receive his messages.

## V. the bar

the narrator finds himself visiting the bar called "Guillotine", he used to frequent. now that he's a dropout, he doesn't have a friend to drink together. he figures his old classmates graduated years ago and probably have jobs now. he orders "free-will", a special cocktail available there. after a visit to toilet, he finds the professor sitting besides his seat at the counter. he orders "lavender tears", the signature drink of the bar. the professor smiles to him and starts talking to him. it's the first non-therapy he has in years.

## VI. the bookstore

the narrator visits the bookstore where he used to date with his lover. the student that's obsessed with pink smiles at him. he overhears her asking the shopkeeper if the store has an Anarchist Cookbook. the shopkeeper asks which one; there's two the original and the communal. the girl answers both. the shopkeeper promises her he'll keep them in reserve when he can get them. the narrator doesn't understand why but the girl pink girl reminds him of his old professor. he used to hand out books to faculty members and students. he is lost in thought until the pink girl awkwardly bow a little to show respect to him before leaving the bookstore. does she recognizes him as a senior?

## VII. the old professor

the narrator is dissociating in his therapist's office. the therapist asks why he thinks he went to the bookstore. the narrator feels like it's a dream. it feels like a deja vu. he's not sure but he feels like he saw the bookkeeper keeping the anarchist cookbooks in reserve. can he see the future? the narrator tells the therapist he misses his old professor, who's a friend of the therapist. in fact his old professor recommended him to see the therapist when he lost himself after losing his lover. he doesn't remember how many times he submitted his resignation letter that ended up being rejected by his old professor. the therapist tells him the old professor was hospitalized. Atlas General, he informs him.

## VIII. the hospital

the narrator feels like he's a ghost in the hospital hallway. he's too anxious to ask at the reception for his old professor's room number. he remember visiting his lover here. everything feels so unreal. she was in comma and he read her dostoevsky books. he knew she hated them but he wished she woke up to shut him up. he fails to collect courage to ask the reception. in truth, he can't bear to relive losing her. in truth, he can't bear to see the face of his old mentor that he failed. he turns back from the hospital hallway. he thinks he sees the pink girl at the pharmacy.

## IX. the office

the narrator find himself in the therapist's office, since the classroom is locked. the therapist asks him what he felt when he was at the hospital. the narrator answers guilt. the therapist wants to know what kind of guilt. the narrator thinks he failed his professor. he wasn't sure if he has a right to see his professor. the therapist asks him if he saw his lover at the hospital. the narrator shakes his head. the therapist assures his professor would love to see him. he says he'll tell the professor about him when he visits the hospital and ends the therapy session.

the dropout, having no where to go, goes to his old professor's office. he doesn't have a panic attack this time. he sees the young professor in his old professor's office. he has books opened across the room just like his old professor. he saw two black books that look like Anarchist Cookbook among them. the young professor looks at his watch and then get up. when he comes out of his office, he notices the narrator and smiles at him awkwardly and then close his office door. he subtly nods his head towards the classroom, asking for the dropout to follow him.

## X. the classroom

the first thing the narrator notices in the classroom is the pink girl. he doesn't know why but she almost looks like she's smiling at him. he awkwardly take a seat in the back. he doesn't understand why he is still attending this class he never enrolled for. he didn't even attend his classes when he was a student.

[we have to find a relevant topic for the lecture here. the class should be a philosophy or mathematics class. the young professor will share his radical but sloppy ideology and the logical student will mercilessly criticizes him again so the pink girl has to come to rescue.]
