## IV. the young professor (prometheus)

## V. the bar

the narrator finds himself visiting the bar called "Guillotine", he used to frequent. now that he's a dropout, he doesn't have a friend to drink together. he figures his old classmates graduated years ago and probably have jobs now. he orders "free-will", a special cocktail available there. after a visit to toilet; they have two toilets, one is labeled "female" and another "other", he finds the professor sitting besides his seat at the counter. he orders "lavender tears", the signature drink of the bar. the professor smiles to him and starts talking to him. it's the first non-therapy he has in years. the professor tells him the paradox about two people, Adam and Ben. Adam is kind and untitled. Ben is strategic and entitled. Adam doesn't get anything he wants and loses everything he love. Ben gets what he wants and rarely lose anything he love. Adam understands people. Ben commands people. people feels safe enough to be rude around Adam but they walk on eggshells around Ben. while Adam brings out the worst nature in people, Ben brings out the civilized nature in people. objectively speaking, from whom the society more? the narrator answers he doesn't care whom the society benefits from. Ben benefits more. but he wishes more people like Adam exist. but he doesn't wish to be like Adam. he wouldn't mind being Adam if he can hold just one thing he loves instead of losing all, thinking about his lover.
