## I. the ceiling fan (tartarus)

The narrator sees his professor through blurred vision. he's trapped in a surreal classroom. He can't grasp his caring professor's words: "are you okay?" His classmates sit facing the opposite direction. The ceiling fan breaks loose and plummets down, severing his classmates' heads. Yet they continue photographing the blackboard, even without their heads. The narrator discovers he's bound to his chair and cuts himself trying to escape. When he crashes into the blackboard—finding no door—he passes through it and emerges in another identical classroom. once again, the narrator sees his professor through blurred vision.

---

## II. the alarm (morpheus)

An alarm wakes up the narrator from a dream. he's still not sure he's in a dream. he drinks a finger of rum from the glass on a chair beside his bed. He goes through normal chores. Without purpose, he finds himself preparing for school even though he doesn't know what class he's taking. He returns home several times for various reasons: checking if he locked the door, forgetting to brush his teeth, forgetting his lighter. He finally gets on a bus. An alarm wakes up the narrator from a dream.

---

## III. the ghost (melinoe)

He realizes the alarm is for his weekly therapy session with his therapist, a psychology professor on campus at his old university, Atlas University. He also realizes he's a dropout now. He sees his deceased lover on the way. He meets his therapist in a classroom and mentions hallucinating his lover. The therapist says he used to mention that the library of Alexandria is still burning. He asks if he still feels the same. He replies he feels like academic institutions should be destroyed to free students' curiosity. The therapist asks if he's talked to anyone recently since he deleted all his social media apps. He answers he has no contact with anyone. Suddenly he remembers visiting the bookstore recently but can't remember why. The therapist asks if he received the monthly support from his late lover's family and if he had any contact with them. The narrator answers he received the money and withdrew it at the ATM but had no contact with them. He dissociates during the session and sees his lover in the university library.

---

## IV. the young professor (prometheus)

After the therapy, he finds himself walking towards his old classroom without purpose. He has a panic attack—it's overwhelming to revisit the place he ran away from years ago. During the panic attack, he notices a young professor in his old classroom. "The only rule in this classroom is that there's no rule because rules are the enemies of studying," the professor declares. The narrator spots a student who mercilessly criticizes the professor's speech. He also notices another student obsessed with the color pink defending the awkward professor. The professor shares lib gen links and teaches them how to pirate textbooks. He mentions a bookstore he likes called "Alexandria" where students from Atlas University resell their textbooks after each year. [I'll add a lecture scene here that's relevant to the anarchist spirit of the story] The young professor reminds him of his old mentor. The narrator texts his lover about the strange professor, knowing full well she'll never receive his messages.

---

## V. the cocktail glass (dionysus)

The narrator finds himself visiting "Guillotine," the bar he used to frequent. Now that he's a dropout, he doesn't have a friend to drink with. He figures his old classmates graduated years ago and probably have jobs now. He orders "free-will," a special cocktail available there. After a visit to the toilet—they have two toilets, one labeled "female" and another "other"—he finds the professor sitting beside his seat at the counter. The professor orders "lavender tears," the bar's signature drink, then smiles at him and starts talking. It's the first non-therapy conversation he's had in years.

The professor tells him a paradox about two people, Adam and Ben. Adam is kind and untitled. Ben is strategic and entitled. Adam doesn't get anything he wants and loses everything he loves. Ben gets what he wants and rarely loses anything he loves. Adam understands people. Ben commands people. People feel safe enough to be rude around Adam, but they walk on eggshells around Ben. While Adam brings out the worst nature in people, Ben brings out their civilized nature. Objectively speaking, from whom does society benefit more?

The narrator answers that he doesn't care whom society benefits from—Ben benefits more. But he wishes more people like Adam existed. Still, he doesn't wish to be like Adam. He wouldn't mind being Adam if he could hold onto just one thing he loves instead of losing it all, thinking about his lover.

---

## VI. the bookstore (calliope)

The narrator visits the bookstore where he used to go on dates with his lover. The student obsessed with pink smiles at him. He overhears her asking the shopkeeper if the store has an Anarchist Cookbook. The shopkeeper asks which one—there are two, athe original and the communal version. The girl wants both. The shopkeeper promises to keep them in reserve when he can get his hands on copies.

The narrator can't pinpoint why, but the pink girl reminds him of his old professor, who used to hand out books to faculty members and students. He's lost in thought until the girl gives him an awkward little bow, showing respect before leaving the bookstore. Does she recognize him as a senior? He texts his lover about the bookstore visit.

---

## VII. the old professor (chiron)

The narrator dissociates in his therapist's office. The therapist asks why he thinks he went to the bookstore. Everything feels dreamlike to the narrator. It feels like a déjà vu. He's not sure, but he swears he saw the shopkeeper setting aside those anarchist cookbooks. Can he see the future?

The narrator tells the therapist he misses his old professor, who happens to be the therapist's friend. His old professor actually recommended this therapist. The narrator can't remember how many resignation letters he submitted, only to have his old professor reject each one. The therapist breaks the news: his old professor was hospitalized at Atlas General. The narrator mentions meeting a strange new professor who took his old professor's place. He's been attending those classes, which pleases the therapist. Perhaps it might reignite his passion for studies.

---

## VIII. the hospital (asclepius)

The narrator drifts through the hospital hallway like a ghost. He's too anxious to approach the reception desk and ask for his old professor's room number. The sterile corridors bring back memories of visiting his lover here. Everything feels surreal, disconnected from reality. After her accident, she lay in a coma while he read Dostoevsky aloud to her unconscious form. He knew she despised those books, but part of him hoped she'd wake up just to tell him to stop. Now he can't summon the courage to ask the receptionist for directions. The truth cuts deeper—he can't bear to relive losing her all over again. He can't face his old mentor, the man he feels he disappointed. This professor was the only one who showed him kindness when others treated him cruelly for being different. He turns away from the hospital corridor. At the pharmacy, he thinks he glimpses the pink girl.

---

## IX. the office

The narrator finds himself in the therapist's office since the classroom remains locked. The therapist asks what he felt at the hospital. "Guilt," the narrator responds. The therapist presses for specifics. The narrator believes he failed his professor and questions whether he even has the right to visit him. When the therapist asks if he saw his lover at the hospital, the narrator shakes his head. The therapist reassures him that his professor would be delighted to see him and would never consider their relationship a failure on either side. He promises to mention the narrator during his next hospital visit, then ends the session.

With nowhere else to go, the dropout heads to his old professor's office. This time, no panic attack overwhelms him. Inside, he finds the young professor surrounded by open books scattered across the room—just like his old mentor used to do. Among them, he spots two black books that resemble the Anarchist Cookbook. The young professor checks his watch and stands. When he emerges from the office, he notices the narrator and offers an awkward smile before locking his door. He subtly nods toward the classroom, silently inviting the narrator to follow.

---

## X. the classroom (peitho)

The first thing the narrator notices in the classroom is the pink girl. He can't explain why, but she almost seems to be smiling at him. He awkwardly claims a seat in the back row. He doesn't understand why he keeps attending this class he never enrolled in—he didn't even show up to his own classes when he was still a student.

the narrator experiences a deja vu. he notices a student mercilessly tearing apart the professor's lecture. he also spots the girl obsessed with the color pink defending the awkward professor with surprising passion. [I'll add a lecture scene here that captures the anarchist spirit of the story]

---

## XI. the canteen

the narrator visits the canteen where he used to eat with his lover. it's packed with students. he orders the same beef ramen he used to share with his lover. across the room, the pink girl subtly bows, offering that same respectful smile. [I'll add a scene where the narrator overhears conversations that push the narrative forward.]

---

## XII. paperwork (sisyphus)

the narrator sits in his old professor's office. his professor doesn't buy the financial hardship and refuses to sign the resignation letter. but he promises support anyway. defeated, the narrator leaves empty-handed. when he tells his lover what happened, she's actually relieved the professor said no. she promises she'll always support him.

days later, he's drafting another resignation letter. this time he cites mental illness. everyone knows about his attention disorder anyway. he approaches his old professor again, begging to quit school. the professor suggests seeing his friend, a therapist in the psychology department. the narrator refuses, but the professor slips him the therapist's number anyway.

---

## XIII. beef ramen

his lover pleads with him to study. he says it's meaningless—he wants to break free from this absurd academic system. she keeps begging. she promises to buy him beef ramen every day if he'll just try. she tells him to study if he loves her. he tells her he does love her, but he won't take this exam. he has no choice—his professor will never let him go unless he abandons the rules completely. she begs him to endure it until graduation. he tells her graduation is just a ceremony where they brand slave marks on your back, and he refuses to wear one. after their longest fight yet, he apologizes and turns off his phone.

---

## XIV. the cookbooks (hestia)

The therapist asks the narrator if he knows what he wants beyond things like seeing his lover. The therapist wants him to say he wants to continue his studies. He considers this but realizes he'd rather attend the class he has no obligation to go to. Instead, he answers that he wants to make food for his comrades, even though he doesn't know who his comrades are. What kind of food, the therapist asks. Burmese tofu, he replies. Why doesn't he make some as practice, the therapist suggests. He says he'll think about it. He used to make tofu for his lover and friends. It would be sad to make tofu with no one to share it with. The therapist suggests sharing it with his old professor. Even if he's too sick to eat some, his daughter would appreciate it.

Missing his old professor, the narrator walks to the young professor's office. He stops along the way to smoke a cigarette. When he reaches the office, he sees the pink girl leaving with two black books in her arms. She doesn't bow this time. The narrator vaguely recalls her asking about anarchist cookbooks at the bookstore. He realizes the books she's carrying are those cookbooks. He doesn't enter the office. He remembers he had his own copies of the cookbooks from the bookstore - that is why he intimately remembers the shopkeeper setting aside those anarchist cookbooks. His lover hated them, especially the original one. He texts his lover about the pink girl: girls these days are reading anarchist cookbooks. He realizes it's been a while since he's seen her.

---

## XV. tofu

It's been a few days since he last saw his therapist. The narrator goes to the grocery store, and when he spots chickpea powder on the shelf, he remembers wanting to make tofu. But he's forgotten how.

He recalls writing recipes in a document on his laptop, but when he gets home, he can't log into his profile. He tries his lover's name, then his lover's birthday, cycling through every password he can think of. He attempts accessing the file from the guest profile, but that fails too.

Frustrated, he looks up the recipe online and starts making tofu. The first batch turns out terrible. He tries again, wishing he could share it with his lover. While waiting for the second batch to set, he reads that someone burglarized the medical labs—the same one he used to visit when his lover was hospitalized. He still carries receipts from there in his wallet, kept as mementos of his lover.

He's almost glad about the burglary. The staff there had been unbearably rude, once even giving him the wrong lab results. This second batch of tofu isn't good either. He starts on a third.

## XVI. the funeral (charon)

The narrator picks up a call from his therapist and learns his old professor has passed away. The news leaves him feeling hollow inside. He dresses carefully and attends the funeral, where he spots the pink girl among the mourners. [TODO: I'll add details here to show that the narrator eventually realizes she's his old mentor's daughter.] He also notices the young professor talking with her.

His therapist approaches to check on his well-being. The narrator confesses sorrowfully that he wishes he'd visited his old professor more. His therapist tries to comfort him, explaining that his friend was unconscious during the hospital visits. But he'd mentioned the narrator often—perhaps the old professor understood him after all.

---

## XVII. the hallway (ate)

The narrator finds himself walking down an endless hallway toward the morgue. He can't understand why the corridor stretches on forever, or why he's desperate to see his mentor's body—especially since he already attended the funeral. [This is a nightmare sequence just like the first chapter.] He used to resent his old mentor for rejecting his resignation letters over and over. Now he wants to apologize for that anger.

Suddenly, he sees strangers wheeling his lover's body out of the morgue. He rushes forward, trying to stop them, and caresses her face with trembling hands. He apologizes for reading Dostoevsky—the only books that helped calm his anxiety. He apologizes again and again, confessing he wishes he'd read her Jane Austen instead. Then his lover's eyes snap open, and he jolts awake.

---

## XVIII. the chessboard

The narrator realizes he's losing his grip on stability again. It's two past midnight, and he keeps playing chess to stay awake, losing game after game. When he finally remembers to check the time, morning has already arrived.

He drags himself to his therapist's office and recounts the dream. His therapist explains that it's normal to feel unstable when old wounds reopen. The only thing he can do now is live in the memory of his lover and professor—live in a way that would make them proud. But as his therapist speaks, the narrator notices he has a bishop's head. Chess patterns are bleeding into everything he sees.

He wants to text his lover but doesn't, crushed by guilt and sorrow. On campus, he spots the student who always demanded rigor from the professor. The student has a knight's head—a horse piece come to life.

---

## XIX. the restroom (eros)

The narrator heads to the "Guillotine" bar after class. The nostalgia hits him like a punch to the gut. He misses his friends desperately—misses throwing darts with them, remembers how they'd hog the pool table with just two balls while other people waited impatiently.

The pink girl's voice pulls him back to the present as she claims the seat across from him. She orders a "Blood of Eden" cocktail. He asks politely how she's doing. She confesses she feels lost without her dad. He lost his father around her age too, but he doesn't mention that he felt relief when his dad died—relief from a lifetime of abuse. She's just like him: alone and adrift.

She tells him about her classes. After a while, she excuses herself for the restroom. He notices she enters the "other" bathroom. Soon after, the young professor walks in and asks to join him at the table. He orders "Lavender Tears" again. When the pink girl returns, she doesn't seem surprised to find her professor there. She smiles at both men and continues discussing her coursework while lighting a cigarette. She mentions that one student who demands perfection in every class—he's exhausting. The professor shrugs, saying he doesn't mind. He's actually grateful the student keeps him sharp.

The singer croons "Apocalypse" by Cigarettes After Sex when the narrator realizes he's lost count of his drinks. Chilled by nostalgia and nausea, he rushes to the restroom. His head finds the toilet bowl as he retches violently. Someone's hand pats his back gently. He can't turn around to look. When the vomiting stops, he slumps onto the floor. The pink girl kneels beside him, her hand still stroking his back. She delicately wipes his lips, smiling softly. She tells him he looks like her dad when he was young, joking that they could be siblings. He manages a weak smile. She caresses his face, kisses his forehead, then his cheek. Awkwardly, she kisses his lips too. Her kiss tastes like strawberries. He neither returns it nor pulls away. He can't understand why the song keeps playing in his head. He doesn't remember if he passed out.

---

## XX. the library

The narrator wakes up at the library, unsure whether he dreamed about kissing the pink girl. The guilt weighs on him just the same. He heads to the professor's office—the only person who was there might know what really happened.

He finds the professor napping at his desk. After knocking to wake him, the professor welcomes him in. "I'm sorry, but I need to know—did we drink yesterday?" he asks. The professor nods. When the narrator admits he can't remember what happened, the professor fills in the gaps: he passed out in the restroom, the girl asked for help, and together they carried him out. It took a while to revive him. They got him a taxi and hoped he made it home safely. As he's about to leave, the professor stops him and hands over a copy of the Tao Te Ching.

---

## XXI. the ghost watcher

It's been weeks since he last saw the pink girl. He doesn't know how or why, but he wants to apologize to her. The classroom debates have become one-sided since she started skipping classes. Maybe she's avoiding him. Maybe she's still dealing with her grief. He feels like she absorbed his despair—though of course that didn't make him feel any better. Seeing her again would be awkward, but he wants to see her again. The professor would probably be just as clueless as him.

He visits the bookstore, hoping to find her there. Instead, he spots the professor and his lover laughing together. They don't seem to see him. He tries to talk to them awkwardly. Even though the lover should be a ghost, they're treating him like a ghost. He even tries screaming, but they still can't hear him. The suffocation overwhelms him. He tells himself it's just a dream—he'll wake up eventually.

---

## XXII. the window glass

The narrator likes to pretend he's teaching when all the classes end for the day. His professor once mentioned he used to practice the same way. He watches his reflection in the window glass. [TODO: Insert a mock lecture for him to rehearse—but keep it light since this is another dream sequence.]

When he looks at the class, he sees the pink girl clapping. She's smiling directly at him. She approaches slowly, seductively. Without understanding why, he pulls her close, his hands finding her waist as he caresses her face. She's so different from his lover, yet he finds her beautiful. She leans in and kisses him. He knows it's wrong, but he can't resist. He's too starved for intimacy.

He removes her clothes. She pulls down his pants. They have sex on the desk, urgent and desperate. In the window's reflection, he catches sight of his face—but it isn't his face at all. It's the young professor's. Confusion washes over him. Is he fantasizing about being the young professor, having sex with his student, his mentor's daughter?

He stares harder at the window glass. Suddenly, he notices someone behind the reflection. He stops abruptly and rushes to the window. There stands his lover, fury blazing in her eyes.

---

## XXIII. the book

The narrator jolts awake, his heart hammering against his ribs in a full panic attack. Once he manages to ground himself and slow his breathing, one thing becomes crystal clear: the young professor isn't normal.

He remembers the professor giving him the Tao Te Ching. But this feels like more than just a book—there's something deeper here that he can't quite grasp. When he thinks about it, he senses his lover's warmth, though he doesn't understand why. Opening the book, he discovers his lover's handwriting on the first page: "We met in Alexandria."

Why does the professor have this book? Did he give it to him as some cruel joke, a way to humiliate him? Determined to confront him, the narrator rehearses what he'll say, how he'll ask the question.

He tries reading the Tao Te Ching, and slowly the memory surfaces—his lover gave this to him as a gift. So how did the professor get it? The situation reminds him of Dostoevsky's "The Double." It's almost like the professor is his doppelganger.

A wild thought crosses his mind: what if he is the professor?

Carefully searching his bag, he finds keys he doesn't recognize. They might open the professor's office. All he needs to do is wait until morning and test whether one of them works. But something else nags at him—isn't there something else that needs a key?

Then he remembers the locked profile on his laptop. He types "wemetinalexandria" and it unlocks.

Inside, he discovers lecture notes in his own writing style. Faculty emails. Social media accounts already logged in. Most shocking of all, he finds he's been messaging his lover. Scrolling through her profile, he sees she's very much alive.

But he remembers her accident clearly—the trip with classmates right after he chose not to take his exam. She'd been in a coma. He texts her: "When is the last time we met?"

Her reply comes quickly: "At the bookstore. Why? Are you losing time again?"

The realization hits him like a physical blow. What he saw at the bookstore wasn't a dream. He was there—as the professor. The professor had locked him out, preventing the others from noticing his true self.

He calls his therapist that morning. When he realizes his therapist already knew the professor was himself, he asks if it's even possible to talk to himself. The therapist retraces how he figured it out, explaining that he first began to suspect something because of the book—the same one he'd gotten from the professor's office.

The therapist suggests he return to the professor's office but warns him to be very gentle with himself. Just as the narrator isn't aware that the professor is himself, the professor might not realize he's the narrator either. "Learn to understand yourself and accept yourself," the therapist advises.

---

## XXIV. confession

The narrator easily opens the professor's office door. He settles into the guest chair and waits. After a while, the professor enters and looks surprised to see him there.

"Is there anything I can help you with?" the professor asks.

The narrator nods. He asks why the professor gave him the Tao Te Ching. The professor explains it's a habit he picked up from his old mentor.

"Did your old professor also hand out his lover's gifts to random people?" the narrator presses.

The professor opens the book and sees the inscription: "We met in Alexandria." He's startled that the narrator knows about his lover. He quietly admits she's his former partner and asks how the narrator knew the book was her gift.

The narrator's anger flares. "Is that student girl your lover now?"

"No," the professor answers.

"Be honest with me. Do you know anything about being physically intimate with that student in the classroom?"

The professor looks ashamed. "I had a dream like that. I felt guilty about it, but there's nothing complicated between us." He's shocked the narrator knows about his dream.

The narrator interrogates him further. "Did you take advantage of your student?"

"I worked on sexual harassment policy when I was a student myself," the professor replies defensively.

"That doesn't mean you're not a hypocrite," the narrator points out.

The professor finally confesses. He admits he has feelings for his student and recognizes his hypocrisy. "I wanted to be intimate with her. Yes, I fantasized about being intimate with her, fully knowing how wrong it's. but I never approached her. I want to save her from me. Because I love her and I hate myself."

Convinced at last, the narrator reveals the truth: "You and I are the same person. Literally."

The professor asks how he sent himself home in a taxi. The narrator explains they might have both been in the taxi, or both been with the girl. Only she knows for sure.

The professor assures him he stayed away from his former lover to protect her too. When the narrator asks how she's still alive, the professor explains she never died. She recovered slowly, then carefully considered their future and broke up with him. He accepted it but wasted a year drowning in alcohol after failing his exam. It was a confusing time for him too. While the narrator clings to therapy, the professor clings to the normal status quo.

"Why does she send you money every month?" the narrator asks.

"It's just my salary," the professor explains. "I didn't want to open a bank account for reasons I don't understand. My old professor asked management to set up payrool method with an account that's not in my name—it's in hers. She offered to help."

---

## XXV. the restaurant

The narrator asks the professor if he can meet the lover. The professor nods, realizing his other self has become as stable as him now. He texts her asking if they could have lunch. She says she's at work and not on campus today—it seems the ghost he once saw was her attending MBA classes.

They meet at the canteen in her workplace, NexBank Head Quarter. He orders beef ramen while she has a salad. She's trying a new diet plan. She mentions her banker fiancé casually. "I'm glad you're here. I usually have lunch with him, but he's attending a meeting at the central bank today."

He interrupts and asks why they didn't work out. She takes a minute to think, then answers, "You love hating the system more than you love me."

He replies, "Hating the system is the only thing I'm good at."

She tells him she still loves him. She continues, "He doesn't hate the system. He tries to change it from inside."

He mocks her: "You mean profit from it."

She laughs and shakes her head, saying even her banker boyfriend admires him. "He finds your papers brilliant."

He replies he doesn't admire bankers—he doesn't even have a bank account, not even as the professor self who compromised his rebellion. He realizes that just like she can't accept him, he can't fully accept her either. Not in the way he accepts the pink girl and the pink girl accepts him. But he'd rather stay away from her to keep her safe.

The narrator and the professor both go home together for the first time. Their shadows merge into one on the sidewalk.

## XXVI. convocation hall (hephaestus)

The narrator asks for help from the professor. He wants to destroy the convocation hall and wipe out student data. The professor, wanting to redeem himself for his shameful sins, gives him access. The narrator phishes the operation admins and gains access to delete student records. Before he starts deleting, he builds a bomb to blow up the hall. He makes a plan to evacuate everyone inside the building with a fake bomb threat, then actually detonate it once everyone is safe.

When the narrator arrives at the professor's office to say goodbye, he finds the pink girl waiting at the front desk. She hands him two resignation letters—hers and the logical student's. The two have become friends now. She also returns the cookbooks, but he refuses to take them back. Instead, he gives her his copy of the Tao Te Ching. After signing their resignation letters, he tells her to be kind. She bows toward him once more.

The narrator then enters the convocation hall and plants both the decoy bomb and the real one. He pulls the fire alarm to evacuate everyone from the building, then pretends to flee alongside the panicked crowd. While running, he executes a script that wipes all the digital records. Once people reach a safe distance, he detonates the building, destroying all the physical records inside.
