# "we met in alexandria"

## I. THE GHOST

A clinically depressed college dropout, drowning in alcohol, hallucinates his deceased lover's ghost on campus during therapy visits. He thinks he quit university when he lost his lover but he barely remembers who he's.

## II. THE PROFESSOR

While having a panic attack, he stumbles into a lecture in his old classroom, by a radical Professor who proclaims: "There's no rule in this class for rules are the enemy of studying", "Convocation is the ceremony of branding slave marks on your back." After the class, he sends texts to his lover's inbox that nobody will ever read about the professor and the strange lecture.

At the bar he used to go to, named "Guillotine", he sees the professor again and talks to him drunk — his first non-therapy human connection in years.

## III. TAO

He gets close to the professor and starts going to the class regularly. The professor doesn't care whether he's enrolled. Visiting the professor's office, he sees two versions of the Anarchist Cookbook sit on the desk: one criminal, one for communal living. He feels a sense of deja vu. The Professor lends him a beer-stained Tao Te Ching. He still texts about everything to his lover.

## IV. SYMPOSIUM

During subsequent lectures, the dropout observes debates between:

- The Professor
- A mercilessly logical student (Science incarnate)
- A pink-obsessed girl (future Strawberry), who defends the Professor with unsettling compassion

## V. LAZARUS

After witnessing the girl borrow both Cookbooks and seeing the Professor interact with his "ghost" in the bookstore he used to go, named "Alexandria", the dropout, out of jealousy —guided by his therapist—investigates the professor and uncovers the truth slowly:

1. The Professor is his dissociated self—the version who graduated while he collapsed
2. His lover is alive; she left him because "You loved hating the system more than you loved me"
3. The ghost was guilt manifest.
4. While he mourned his lover, the professor mourned the rebellion

## VI. ALEXANDRIA

When the pink girl returns the Cookbooks (having only studied the communal one), the professor gives her his Tao Te Ching as she and the logical student quit school. United with his fractured self, he bombs the convocation hall— as a declaration of his love for his students and science. "I want you to see the system in its real form that's in flames, I don't mind being named the arsonist." The pink girl and the student watch the flames from afar.
