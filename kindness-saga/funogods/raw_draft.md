## Chapter I - Stationary Action [Science]

"Oh my sweet Science, did you just derive Hamilton's Principle," mom said, looking at the whiteboard.

"I'll never understand how such a beautiful mind was conceived inside me. When I was 10, I was dressing up paper dolls. I'll never be as brilliant as you, my dear." I could sense an overwhelming intensity of joy and pride in her voice. She wasn't just looking at a whiteboard filled with mathematical equations. She was looking at my weeks of exhausting work on these mechanics problems. My investigation of the physical world in the language I'm most fluent with.

I felt relieved. I got somewhere finally without getting entangled in specificalities. I wasn't pursuing physics like mom; she was a nuclear physicist working at the University of Copenhagen. I was more drawn to the pure beauty of mathematical abstraction. Physics was her passion; mathematics was mine. While she saw the beauty in theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, I was captivated by the elegant magic of describing the universe through pure abstraction. But aren't we approaching the same truth from different sides? Isn't it the beauty of Science, anyway?

"Will you have your dinner now, my baby Science? I made your favourite dish." I could never fully express how much I loved mom. She knew I wouldn't have dinner without getting somewhere. I almost forgot how hungry I was.

Mom called me Science. It was what she loved most in the entire universe. I believed she never hesitated to name me Science; it must have been as if she never considered another word that could describe her love for me. I never knew who my dad was. Neither did my mom. One day, she realized she wanted to give birth to me and contacted her friend at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. She had always known physical intimacy wasn't her way of connecting with others. Throughout her life, she'd had occasional relationships, but maintaining them without getting physical proved challenging. In the end, she chose a path of motherhood that was entirely her own. She ticked 'anonymous donor' in the form, despite her curious mind of a scientist. A mysterious donor giving me the other half of genes seemed more profound than someone she could contact. Who my father was never mattered to me or my mom. There were more than enough problems we could enjoy solving.

I had to bring a textbook to the dinner table. I couldn't wait to compare my derivation with the textbooks. Mom mentioned the exact chapter I needed to look up. I could swear these mathematical symbols danced with an ethereal luminescence before my eyes. I realized I had traced the same beautiful mathematical path others had walked before me. The joy wasn't in being first, but in understanding the universal language that explains the universe.

I remembered how happy mom was when I was more curious about how the ball moved when you threw it rather than playing with it. "Mom, does that boy know how to catch the ball because he can predict its route from the initial configuration?" I remember she laughed. She gave me Euclid's Elements for my 7th birthday. It was still my favorite book of all time. She taught me physics before I knew who I was. But there was always this skepticism that made me hesitant to intuitively accept physical laws for granted. Why was light refracted this way instead of all the other possible paths? I realized now I understood these phenomena in the most abstract sense human science can explain.

I spent a few more weeks deriving all the other physics principles I knew from one universal principle I just rediscovered; that of stationary action. One day, I decided to send an email to Luna on mom's computer. Before I talked about Luna, I needed to talk about mom's secret work, or at least what I call her secret work. I always hated when mom had to travel to work with her physicist colleagues from Santandería. She often brought me to university conferences, but these foreign colleagues remained a mysterious presence, always kept at a distance from my little world. I never nagged her to take me with her though.

"I'll only be away for four days, my baby Science. Luna will be here to look after you."

She always asked Luna to babysit me. Luna was her graduate student. She was always very kind to me. Unlike other people, she never treated me like I was weird. It never looked like babysitting with her. It was more like a private lecture; except that neither of us would know who was supposed to be the lecturer. I used to ask her a lot of questions that I would've asked mom if she was with me. I thought she might've found them frustrating but she found them fun. It was how Luna realized she could offload her assignments to my little brain. Sometimes my skepticism could help her see something she missed because she took it for granted. She always appreciated my strong sense of rigour in everything.

"For the last time, my sweet Science, Luna is my graduate student. Not yours. Please don't help her with her homework," mom said laughingly. I nodded. I knew it was Luna when I heard the door knock. I ran to help her carry the bags to my mom's room where Luna would stay at. She brought two bags of textbooks.

"Luna, I'll fail your entire assignment if my son solves it for you—and I'll enjoy doing it," mom warned her with a straight face. Luna smiled sheepishly.

"It's ok, mom. These books are for me. I'd like to start studying other sciences for a change," I defended Luna. Luna gestured towards a bag with a subtle nod of her chin, and I unzipped it to reveal the contents to mom. 'The Origin of Species' and a collection of biology texts Luna had borrowed from the university library sat inside. Mom's hand found its way to my head, rubbing it with a mixture of affection and pride. She turned to Luna, expressing her gratitude with a warmth that transcended words.

When her colleagues' car pulled up outside, she bid us both farewell. Luna and I walked her to the car, helping her load her luggage for the trip.

"Have a safe trip, Professor Alma. I'll make sure Science won't do my assignments," said Luna with an attempt to light up the dim moment.

Mom laughed, holding Luna's hand. "Take care of my little scientist," she said, then turned to ruffle my hair. We watched the car move away from us until it was out of our view.

Luna and I went back to my mom's room. I couldn't wait to open Darwin's book. Luna settled into mom's desk chair, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Hey little buddy, what changed your mind suddenly? You always demanded more rigorous equations in my homework than even Professor Alma did. Do you feel like you finished everything you wanted to do with physics?"

I shook my head. "I'm afraid I won't be able to finish working with the secrets of the universe anytime soon. But isn't the fun more about exploring the secrets rather than actually finding them? I feel uncomfortable when I don't find something rigorous. I'm sorry if I've sounded like I'm too demanding. I just don't know how to be comfortable without understanding something rigorously. Thank you for always being patient with me."

"You're welcome, little buddy. I hope you find a fantastic journey with biology. Just let me know whenever you want me to look for more books. Ah, I almost forgot, my friend from the Department of Biology said she's willing to help with anything you find confusing."

I nodded. I grabbed Darwin's book in my arms and went to my bedroom to start reading it.

## Chapter II - Wavelength of Justice [Art]

I hated shrinks. They acted like they could fix people like a mechanic fixed an engine. I was not an engine. I was just a creative little brat. The beauty of an engine lies in its mechanical nature while mine lies in organic nature that other organic creatures like my parents failed to grasp. It started with me siding with the girl who was bullied at school. I could tell they had been bullying her for a long time.

"Aria, did you really see them hurting her?" the teacher asked.

I was stunned by their question. How could they possibly doubt the victim? I've always been perceptive, but how blind did they have to be to suspect the victim might be lying? Couldn't they see the obvious scars?

"Please don't tell me I'm the only one who can see the scars," I responded.

The girl looked at me apologetically. She had convinced the teachers it was just an accident. I didn't blame her. It made perfect sense to not expect justice from such teachers. It was clever of her to avoid making her bullies hate her more than they already did. If only it would stop them from bullying her again.

I would never forget their mocking eyes. The shameless teachers not only failed to recognize their moral bankruptcy but also told my parents I was fabricating stories. I wished it was the end of the story but it wasn't.

"Aria, what's your favourite on the bookshelf?" Mr. David Lysandra asked.

Mr. David was my mom's friend. He was a professor at Atlas University, visiting Athens for a conference. My parents invited him to our home. They said he wanted to get to know me since he heard about me from my mom. He was taking a look at my books, as if I didn't know what he was doing.

"Let me guess. Is it Homer?" he said, with his eyes almost begging me for a validation. I nodded since I knew nothing better to do. He was right anyway. He tried to hide his smirk.

"Aria, your mom told me what happened at your school."

Of course, she had to tell her friend what happened. Her crazy little daughter obsessed with mythical tales, making up the tale where she was a hero. What upset me was something else.

"Mr. David, could you call me Art instead, please? I don't like to be called Aria." I interrupted him, trying to sound as polite as I could.

"Of course. Art, I can see that you have a good taste in literature. I admire your personality. I said your mom told me what happened but I don't believe she knew everything."

Of course, he had to try to get inside my head. Of course, he was a shrink. Of course, they asked him for his diagnosis. Of course, I knew something was up. I didn't know why but I agreed to talk to him. I had no intention of proving I was sane. I just saw a faint luminous thread connected to him that apparently nobody else could see.

"I understand you must have your reasons for reporting to the teachers," he continued.

"How long have you known the girl who was hurt?"

I genuinely had no idea how to explain to him. I didn't know the girl or the bullies. They weren't even from my class. I saw her scars and I saw their cruel punchable faces.

"I met her the first time yesterday," I replied honestly.

"Was she already hurt when you met her?" he asked. At least he was more patient than the teachers that dismissed me. I nodded.

"Did she tell you how she got hurt?" he asked, almost sounding like he genuinely cared. I shook my head. She didn't need to speak; her scars told the entire story.

"How did you feel when you saw her hurt, Art?" he asked calmly. I hated his measured tone. I wasn't the one who had been bullied—she was. Why wasn't he treating her instead? Or better yet, why wasn't he treating the bullies?

"Spicy," I answered. Stupid answer for stupid question.

"Elena often told me about your special talent. Have you ever heard of something called synesthesia?"

He seemed determined to get under my skin. Yes, I could hear colors and see songs. Did colorblind people treat others differently just because they perceived colors differently? Basic senses, like touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste, were all just about perceiving waves, and my senses were simply strong enough to perceive them in ways most people couldn't. I didn't see how this had anything to do with my sense of justice.

"Is it when I can smell skepticism in your voice?" I responded, attempting to look respectful. He smiled.

"You have a beautiful mind that perceives the world differently from most people. I think your parents were unnecessarily worried," he said, slowly beginning to make sense.

"Why did you feel like you wanted to tell the teachers about the little girl?"

Again, he was circling back to the start. I hated being interrogated. I hated being diagnosed. If I weren't intrigued by his luminous thread, I wouldn't even be tolerating this talk.

"It was my mistake. I saw no sense of justice in the teachers' eyes. But I reported what I saw anyway, in case I was mistaken. Unfortunately, I wasn't," I explained respectfully.

His eyes brightened with curiosity.

"Were you saying you felt like you already knew the end result?" It was a good question. If only his voice didn't smell of skepticism. I nodded.

"How do you feel knowing you weren't wrong?" He seemed endless in his questioning.

"Salty. I couldn't help trying to help her. It was my fault I got the authorities involved." I noticed his interest in my choice of words.

"So you felt like the authorities failed you?" Another good question. If only I couldn't sense the skepticism in his voice.

"I wouldn't care if they failed me. They failed her. They harassed a victim. They tried to spin a narrative that I was complicating their job."

"Art, I understand how you feel. I know you still sense skepticism in my voice. It's because I'm trying to understand you objectively."

If I were to be honest, I finally found this shrink interesting. I realized where he was mistaken. He should have been trying to understand me subjectively. He should have forgotten child psychology. He should have forgotten his diagnostic tools. He should have unlearned everything he learned.

"I believe you're a kind kid. You understand your emotions well. You have good intentions. But the justice system is a little more complicated."

If only 'complicated' were a synonym for 'flawed', I whispered.

"It's not just your school. This situation is quite common. I'd understand the context better if I could talk to the girl and the other children you said were hurting her."

Exactly. He wasn't looking for the missing ring in the wrong place. How nice it would be if I couldn't see through his intention. He wasn't searching for the missing ring at all in the first place; he was simply examining the wrong place for the wrong reason. I found his approach amusing. I needed to give something witty to someone so completely missing the point.

"What's the difference between a therapist and a lawyer?" I asked him.

"A suit?" he answered, after thinking for a while.

He was funny. I could've been friends with him if he weren't a therapist trying to diagnose me.

"Exactly. Both of them listen to you and then convince you of a truth you can tolerate."

"What do you think is the version of the truth you can live with?" he asked instantly.

"I don't settle for a palatable truth. I expose the failures of authority. One layer at a time," I explained.

I was certain he was impressed. He admitted to admiring my resilience. He went on to reassure my parents about what happened at school. My perception of reality was so intense that it might have been impossible to investigate through conventional facts. I didn't even tell him I saw a luminous thread connected to him. In fact, I told nobody about it. Seeing that nobody seemed to notice it, I knew it was something I should've kept to myself. I never learned the exact details of his conversation with my parents, but somehow they misinterpreted his words, ultimately concluding I was struggling with Schizotypal Personality Disorder.

## Chapter III - Sappho's Lyre [Love]

War had always been intimately close to me even when I was in my mom's womb. Ashes, blood and tears, I knew sufferings before I knew my name. I was born tired of all the sufferings in the world.

"How could I know my life would be changed when I interviewed him?" mom said, with a hint of tears in her eyes.

Mom was tending to her lyre. I put my head on the little remaining area of her lap like I always did.

"He had strong hands and sharp eyes. His calm voice shook my heart. My life was dull and lifeless before he came in to it. He gave me a purpose. He gave me Love. He gave me you," she went on. I listened to her with all the care in my heart, even though I've heard the same story more times than I could count. Wasn't I the only thing that was left of him for her?

"Galvarino, your dad," she said softly—her heart gazing into abyss, "he was the bravest man I've ever met. Came from the wild blood of Veridia. The same blood that flows in you. No wonder you're so full of courage, Love." She called me Love, the same thing that she called him. Her soft fingers ran through my hair. I sensed so much love flowing from her fingers.

"I wished I were as brave as you and your dad," she confessed with a heavy heart.

I was a daughter of two warriors. While my dad's weapon was a gun and my mom's a pen, my weapon of choice would be a needle. Didn't the world have too much suffering already? I never got a chance to see my dad. He was dead before I was born. Grew up as a fatherless child, all I ever longed for was a safe haven.

I never wanted mom to continue my dad's fight and yet I understood her mission; it was the least she could do in his name. All her life, she had worked hard for the preservation of indigenous languages in the Crescent where the borders of three countries met; one of which was Veridia, where my dad was born and died. Her life was destined to be doomed from the beginning. Perhaps so was mine. I always knew she wouldn't change a thing in her life even if she knew how it would end. I wouldn't change a thing in my life either despite the endless melancholy that followed me everywhere. What a tragedy it was that my two hands would never be enough to heal the world. What a tragedy it was that my two hands would never be enough to heal my mom.

I never told her I could hear the words she left unspoken. I wished I could find a way to ease her despair.

"I'm scared, my Love. I told you I published a paper. But it wasn't just an academic paper. I'm scared, my baby Love. I had to do it. It was the least I could do for the brothers and sisters of your dad that I never met. For the blood of my Love. For the blood of the brave. For the blood of the forgotten. For the blood that still remained. For the blood that is still bleeding. I've put all my heart into my paper. My colleagues that reviewed it didn't have a clue. They helped me release a declaration of war. Of course, I know it wouldn't be enough. Those that took away Galvarino won't stop. I'm not strong enough. Why am I not strong enough? Lord, please spare some mercy for my innocent child if I can't be saved."

She kept her despair locked inside, as if silence could prevent the inevitable, as if it could shield me from feeling the weight of her heart.

I closed my eyes on her lap while she repeated the tales of my dad that she would never get tired of telling.

"Are you asleep, my Love?" she asked softly. I shook my head without opening my eyes.

"Your dad had a strong mind. Nothing terrified him, except for one. It was hilarious. His only weakness was a gay man. He didn't know he was gay. He thought I was in love with him. It was my friend David," she started laughing, almost innocently. Until everything went back to her.

"Love, I need to tell you something important," she continued with a sense of urgency that I hated, "please try to remember this friend's name. His name is David Lysandra. I think he's in Atlas City. In case I was to be assigned to take a work trip suddenly..." she continued, trying her best to hide her shaking voice, "David will look after you. He was there for me when I gave birth to you. He's always been the best, after your dad."

I nodded, without opening my eyes, trying to hide the tears. I knew what was coming. Not because I was a wise child. But because my mom was a wise woman. She knew what was coming. I knew everything she knew. All you needed to do was feel her heartbeat. Feeling everything who you love feel was the least I could do. If only I closed my eyes hard enough. If only I hugged her hard enough. If only I wished hard enough this moment of warmth could last for an eternity.

She faced Death the exact same way the love of her life did. It was said that it was an accident. A stray bullet from a gang war in the neighborhood, in Bogotá. I wished I didn't know better. Why did she arrange everything to move me to Atlas City after her funeral if it was just an accident? Why did she have to live in fear without sharing it with me? Her lyre was the only thing I could take, in memory of her.

## Chapter IV - Barrel Gambit [Politics]

I never told my parents I hated chess. Because I loved spending time with them. Dad would spend entire days playing chess with me. It might have been an escape from his career for him. He was a political scientist. He often said chess was the only truly fair game he knew.

The knights were my favorite pieces—ninjas of the chessboard. They could penetrate seemingly impregnable fortresses, often with an intention of not coming back alive. Their mission is sometimes as subtle as supporting a frontline piece from the shadows. If it were up to me, I'd have wanted four knights instead of two knights and two bishops. Of course, it would drain your mental stamina more rapidly to keep track of four knights instead of two.

I never got as good at chess as my dad. I couldn't win a game against him if he weren't intentionally making suboptimal moves; he tried to hide his best but I saw through his act. Did he really think he could fool his son who inherited his tactical intuition?

I remember the tender look in mom's eyes when I questioned the pawn's fate—condemned to a war where they seemed most vulnerable. Dad took it as an opportunity to explain the concept of promotion; which I never quite understood. What difference did it make to become a queen, rook, or knight if you were still trapped in the same war?

What I found most interesting in chess is stalemate. I hated sacrificing pieces. I hated exchanging pieces as if there were a mysterious formula to calculate their values. I hated cornering someone. I hated being cornered. I hated checkmates more than the others. A stalemate is something as bold as Diogenes telling Alexander to stand out of the sun.

My dad used to hate it when I decided to resign too early until I explained to him how I knew I was already lost. Sometimes he was surprised that even he didn't see he was winning himself. I could never quite tell if his surprise was genuine or carefully calculated. He said even though I had very little knowledge of chess opening strategies, my tactical insight surpassed his already because I could see through his moves even better than himself. He must have made a lot of effort to hide it when he was intentionally making a suboptimal move. We kind of invented a new rule; I would win if I could tell he intentionally made a suboptimal move so we could finish dishonest games where he wanted to balance the odds fast and prolong honest exhausting games. Of course it would only work if he wouldn't lie. I never saw my parents lied to me; not just me, they never lied to anyone. But I noticed my dad often pretended to be clueless. I was too young to understand it was a tactical necessity sometimes.

Mom would never pretend. She was the most innocent soul I'd ever known—until I would later meet her who matched mom's pure spirit. Mom was a computer scientist. She introduced me to programming long before I could fully learn to write in a natural language. Together, we programmed a simplified version of chess—a 6x6 board with just 5 pawns, and 2 knights on each side. Oh, how much my dad hated that game. It was where I could beat him without him having to make subtle bad moves. He could try his best and I'd either win or draw. I was only trying to stalemate. He simply failed to avoid mistakes. Even though he never admitted it, I knew he found that very frustrating.

Mom and dad had always been a perfect match in every sense that mattered. They met each other at the University of Vienna. Dad came from a South American country called the Republic of Veridia. He settled here in Vienna with mom. Though he continued fighting for his people through academic discourse, I could sense him drowning in the guilt, thinking he had turned his back on his homeland. Mom had always been a great help to him, providing not only emotional support but also critical data analysis for his research and activism work. They were always remarkably open about their activism. Their colleagues looked alarmed and frightened every time they mentioned it. I always found it so funny how they lowered their voices suddenly, as if someone trying to spy on them wouldn't notice it.

"Why do your friends look so weird everytime you mention politics?" I asked dad once.

"Polis," he said—my parents called me Polis for Politics in short—"it's because they fear being in danger. Many people lost their jobs when they spoke out. Some were even sentenced on political charges. Their fear isn't irrational. But I wouldn't call them my friends. What I'm doing isn't even politics in the traditional sense. I wouldn't even call what I'm doing politics.

"I've told you about my friend Galvarino, right? He was like a brother to me. We protested together, drank together, studied together. He returned to our homeland while I remained here, like a coward. He lost his life fighting for what he believed in Veridia.

"So I can't blame people for their fear either. I never intend to put them in danger by being open about sensitive topics. Nobody would suspect them of collaborating with us. They were never truly in danger. Speaking out is just the least I can do in the name of justice. Actually, it's more convenient to observe their fear. Unlike a game of chess, discussions are often required to see each other's perspective. It's my duty as an activist to constantly declare my stance."

"How do you know the risk you're taking is safe enough?" I asked.

"I don't. I'm not immune to fear. I know the danger better than my colleagues do. But I understand the danger of fear even more profoundly. Let me tell you about Galvarino. The original Galvarino—the warrior my friend was named after. He was a Mapuche warrior who fought against Spanish colonists in South America, during a time when Europeans were ruthlessly colonizing indigenous lands. They captured Galvarino and cut off his hands as a brutal punishment, then released him alongside other prisoners to spread terror. Fear, they believed, was the most effective tool of oppression.

"But Galvarino refused to become an agent of fear. Can you imagine what he did? He fastened knives to his mutilated wrists and continued fighting. Instead of being held back by fear, he inspired his comrades. He transformed his wounds into weapons of resistance.

"Unfortunately," dad continued, his voice heavy with a pain that seemed incurable, "he was eventually caught and executed."

I saw my admiration for Galvarino reflected in dad's eyes. I knew he carried the same reverence for both the historical warrior and his namesake friend.

"The battlegrounds might have changed," dad said, "but the spirit of resistance remains the same. Politics is like a more complicated game of chess, Polis. To let fear control you is to trap your pieces yourself. But overcoming fear doesn't guarantee an advantage either. You must maneuver with precision and purpose. We don't speak out merely to endanger ourselves—our activism is both a shield and a sword. A move that's both attacking and defensive. Our visibility as known activists offers a form of protection. We forge connections with allies and, equally important, we identify those who stand against justice. Chess is just a simplified metaphor for the complex strategies of life. Polis, I always knew you hated chess. I needed you to be prepared with that mode of thinking. Understanding the purpose behind the moves is a necessary step in the fight for justice. I wished you wouldn't hate me for asking you to endure chess."

I shook my head. Why would I hate him for that? Wasn't he the one who taught me to see the difference between the pieces, the hand moving the pieces and the meaning of the moves? Of course, I understood what he wanted me to see. Not that it made me hate chess any less, though.

## Chapter V - New Steps [Science]

Mom followed her hero, Marie Curie, when I was 13. You would've thought scientists would no longer be in such a risk with the advancement of technology and safety mesurements. Nonetheless, she got ill from her exposure to radiation. Even though I suspected it might not have been as simple, I kept it to myself. Mom kept it to herself. Luna kept it to herself.

Luna promised mom, on her dying bed, she would take care of me.

Luna's family took me in as her foster brother, into their farmhouse on the outskirts of Copenhagen. They gave me her brother's old room in the attic—a cozy, trapezium-shaped space under the slant of the red brick roof. The wooden floorboards creaked a familiar path from the bed to the small window, which looked out over a yellowish-green field that seemed to stretch forever. For months, I’d wake up each morning disoriented, my hand reaching for a light switch that wasn't on the right wall and my heart aching for the familiar crack in the ceiling of my old bedroom. Euclid's Elements was the only relic I brought from the past.

They found it weird that my name was Science. They preferred to call me Alma's child. Apart from Luna, I could barely talk to anyone. Luna continued to homeschool me just like my mom did. We still didn't know who was teaching whom though. The more I spent my time burying my face in books, the less I knew how to communicate with other people.

I would always be grateful to Luna for bringing me hundreds of books from the library. At least I didn't need to send her an email anymore. Not knowing how to cope with the loss of my mom, I punished myself by studying the fields I would never wanted to before, such as Computer Science, Data Science, and Forensic Science. I wasn't even trying to find an evidence that mom's death was orchestrated. In fact, I was very afraid to find out the answer. It was a puzzle I never wanted to solve. If mom had been in danger, was Luna also in danger? How could I protect her if I couldn't even talk to a stranger? I often locked myself in the room, pretending I was a plant; hoping in case of a further tragedy, nothing would hold me accountable. The deeper I dived into unfamiliar subjects, the more I could forget my life.

Luna often offered to take me when she went out with her friends for a change of scenery. I always declined except for the first time. Her friends were really nice and friendly and didn't even bother me. I just felt uncomfortable with new people. I still felt uncomfortable with Luna's parents whom I shared the home with. While they treated me as their own child, all I did was eat, sleep, read books and ignore them. I never stopped feeling guilty for not knowing how to talk to them.

Luna helped me contact with incredible professors from universities worldwide. Scholarships were just an application away. I didn't know why I never submitted one. One day, I realized it might have been a mistake to contact the professors in the first place. As much as I hated it, I had to keep myself detached from the name Alma Kristensen; the nuclear physicist that gave me life. I had to keep myself detached from Luna. I realized how fortunate it was that I hid in the shadows for years.

Luna came to my room to give me some books as usual. It had been 7 years since I got here. She'd already started working as an assistant professor at mom's department. She had to know this conversation was coming.

"Luna, I know you still think of me as an innocent brother. I appreciate everything you did for me. I'm 20 now. I think I should go to a university and explore the world myself."

It wasn't hard to convince her. She agreed. She wondered if I would like to join the academic path she took. I shook my head. I wanted to walk my own path that was different from mom's and Luna's. Luna tried to convince me she could pull some strings and got me enrolled to her class. I refused. For her own safety, Alma Kristensen's son shouldn't have anything to do with Luna. I explained to her that I didn't want a trail of paperwork to trace where I went. It was wise that I lived in the attic like someone that never existed. I needed to remained as a ghost.

"Can I use mom's retirement funds?"

"Of course, it's yours. I don't think you need to worry about financial things. I'm worried that you find it difficult to talk to people. I could do the talking for you, here, at my department."

"Luna, trust me. I'll be ok. The less I talk, the easier I can be a ghost. It's meant to be my protection."

I didn't know how to explain what I truly feared without sounding like a paranoid lunatic. I thanked God for Luna understanding me. Didn't she take me into her family because she could imagine the danger? Even though I could see her worries, she accepted my new journey. She came up with reasonable explanations to give her parents. They wished the best for me. I spent my last days enjoying their warmth. I didn't know how sad it would be to leave my second home.
