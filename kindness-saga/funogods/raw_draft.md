## chapter i (Science)

"Oh my sweet Science, did you just derive Hamilton's Principle," mom said, looking at the whiteboard.

"I'll never understand how such a beautiful mind was conceived inside me. When I was 10, I was dressing up paper dolls. I'll never be as brilliant as you, my dear." I could sense an overwhelming intensity of joy and pride in her voice. She wasn't just looking at a whiteboard filled with mathematical equations. She was looking at my weeks of exhausting work on these mechanics problems. My investigation of the physical world in the language I'm most fluent with.

I felt relieved. I got somewhere finally without getting entangled in specificalities. I wasn't pursuing physics like mom; she was a nuclear physicist working at the University of Copenhagen. I was more drawn to the pure beauty of mathematical abstraction. Physics was her passion; Mathematics was mine. While she saw the beauty in theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, I saw the beauty in the elegant magic of describing the universe through pure abstraction. But aren't we approaching the same truth from different sides? Isn't it the beauty of Science, anyway?

"Will you have your dinner now, my baby Science? I made your favourite dish." I could never fully express how much I loved mom. She knew I wouldn't have dinner without getting somewhere. I almost forgot how hungry I was.

Mom called me Science. It was what she loved most in the entire universe. I believed she never hesitated to name me Science; it must have been as if she never considered another word that could describe her love for me. I never knew who my dad was. Neither did my mom. One day, she realized she wanted to give birth to me and contacted her friend at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. She had always known physical intimacy wasn't her way of connecting with others. Throughout her life, she'd had occasional relationships, but maintaining them without getting physical proved challenging. In the end, she chose a path of motherhood that was entirely her own. She ticked 'anonymous donor' in the form, despite her curious mind of a scientist. A mysterious donor giving me the other half of genes seemed more profound than someone she could contact. Who my father was never mattered to me or my mom. There were more than enough problems we could enjoy solving.

I had to bring a textbook to the dinner table. I couldn't wait to compare my derivation with the textbooks. Mom mentioned the exact chapter I needed to look up. I could swear these mathematical symbols danced with an ethereal luminescence before my eyes. I realized I had traced the same beautiful mathematical path others had walked before me. The joy wasn't in being first, but in understanding the universal language that explains the universe.

I remembered how happy mom was when I was more curious about how the ball moved when you threw it rather than playing with it. "Mom, does that boy know how to catch the ball because he can predict its route from the initial configuration?" I remember she laughed. She gave me Euclid's Elements for my 7th birthday. It was still my favorite book of all time. She taught me physics before I knew who I was. But there was always this skepticism that made me hesitant to intuitively accept physical laws for granted. Why was light refracted this way instead of all the other possible paths? I realized now I understood these phenomena in the most abstract sense human science can explain.

I always hated when mom had to travel to work with her physicist colleagues from Santandería. She often brought me to university conferences, but these foreign colleagues remained a mysterious presence, always kept at a distance from my little world. I never nagged her to take me with her though.

"I'll only be away for four days, my baby Science. Luna will be here to look after you."

She always asked Luna to babysit me. Luna was her graduate student. She was always very kind to me. Unlike other people, she never treated me like I was weird. It never looked like babysitting with her. It was more like a private lecture; except that neither of us would know who was supposed to be the lecturer. I used to ask her a lot of questions that I would've asked mom if she was with me. I thought she might've found them frustrating but she found it fun. It was how Luna realized she could offload her assignments to my little brain. Sometimes my skepticism could help her see something she missed because she took it for granted. She always appreciated my strong sense of rigour in everything.

"For the last time, my sweet Science, Luna is my graduate student. Not yours. Please don't help her with her homework," mom said laughingly. I nodded. I knew it was Luna when I heard the door knock. I ran to help her carry the bags to my mom's room where Luna would stay at. She brought two bags of textbooks.

"Luna, I'll fail your entire assignment if my son solves it for you — and I'll enjoy doing it," mom warned her with a straight face. Luna smiled sheepishly.

"It's ok, mom. These books are for me. I'd like to start studying other sciences for a change," I defended Luna. Luna gestured towards a bag with a subtle nod of her chin, and I unzipped it to reveal the contents to mom. 'The Origin of Species' and a collection of biology texts Luna had borrowed from the university library sat inside. Mom's hand found its way to my head, rubbing it with a mixture of affection and pride. She turned to Luna, expressing her gratitude with a warmth that transcended words.

When her colleagues' car pulled up outside, she bid us both farewell. Luna and I walked her to the car, helping her load her luggage for the trip.

"Have a safe trip, Professor Alma. I'll make sure Science won't do my assignments," said Luna with an attempt to light up the dim moment.

Mom laughed, holding Luna's hand. "Take care of my little scientist," she said, then turned to ruffle my hair. We watched the car move away from us until it was out of our view.

Luna and I went back to my mom's room. I couldn't wait to open Darwin's book. Luna settled into mom's desk chair, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Hey little buddy, what changed your mind suddenly? You always demanded more rigorous equations in my homework than even Professor Alma did. Do you feel like you finished everything you wanted to do with physics?"

I shook my head. "I'm afraid I won't be able to finish working with the secrets of the universe anytime soon. But isn't the fun more about exploring the secrets rather than actually finding them? I feel uncomfortable when I don't find something unrigorous. I'm sorry if I've sounded like I'm too demanding. I just don't know how to be comfortable without understanding something rigorously. Thank you for always being patient with me."

"You're welcome, little buddy. I hope you find a fantastic journey with biology. Just let me know whenever you want me to look for more books. Ah, I almost forgot, my friend from the Department of Biology said she's willing to help with anything you find confusing."

I nodded. I grabbed Darwin's book in my arms and went to my bedroom to start reading it.

## chapter ii (Art)

I hated shrinks. They acted like they could fix people like a mechanic fixed an engine. I was not an engine. I was a creative little brat. It started with me siding with the girl that was bullied at the school. They had been bullying her for a long time. "Astrid, did you really see them hurting her?" It was beyond me how they could asked me like that. I've always been creative but how creative did they have to be to suspect the victim might have been falsely accusing the bullies? Were they blind to the obvious scars? "Please don't tell me I'm the only one that can see the scars." The girl looked at me apologetically. She convinced the teachers she had an accident. I didn't blame her. It made perfect sense to not expect any justice from such teachers. It was clever of her to not make her bullies hate her more than they already did. I would never forget the mocking eyes. So the shameless teachers not only failed to see their moral failure but also informed my parents that I was making up things that weren't there.

"Astrid, I understand you must have your reason to report to the teachers," said my mom's good friend, Mr. David Lysandra. He was a professor from Atlas University, visiting Athens for a conference. My parents invited him to our home. They said he wanted to get to know me since he heard about me from my mom. But I could see he was a shrink and they asked for his diagnosis. They really thought I was making things up.

"How long have you known the girl that was hurt?" Mr. David asked gently. I genuinely had no clue how to explain to them. I didn't know the girl nor the bullies. I saw her scars and I saw their punchable eyes. "I met her the first time yesterday," I replied honestly.

"Were she already hurt when you met her?" At least he was more patient than the teachers that dismissed me. I nodded.

"Did she tell you how she got hurt?" he almost sounded like he cared about her. I shook my head. She didn't need to; the scars told the story themselves. 

"How did you feel when you saw her hurt?" asked he very calmly. I hated his calm voice. I wasn't the one that had been bullied. She was. Why weren't he treating her instead? Or better yet, why weren't he treating the bullies?

"Spicy," I answered. Stupid answer for stupid question. 

"Elena often told me about your special talent. Have you ever heard of something called synesthesia?" He was almost like he was trying to get on my nerves. Yes, I could hear colors and I could see songs. Did colorblind people treat normal people different because they saw colors they couldn't see? These attributes were all waves and my sense were simply strong enough to perceive those waves differently than most people do. I didn't think it had anything to do with my sense of justice. 

"Is it when I can smell skepticism in your voice?" I answered trying to look as respectful as I could. He smiled. 

"You have a beautiful mind that perceives the world differently than most people. I think your parents were unnecessarily worried about you." He began to make sense slowly. 

"Why did you feel like you want to tell the teachers about the little girl?" He was back to the beginning again. I always hated being interrogated. I always hated being diagnosed.

"It was my bad. I felt no sense of justice in the eyes of the teachers. But I told them about her anyway in case I was wrong. Unfortunately I wasn't wrong." I explained respectfully. His eyes brightened with curiosity.

"Were you saying you felt like you already knew the end result?" he made a good question. How nice it would have been if his voice didn't smell like skepticism. I nodded.

"How do you feel to know you weren't wrong?" Would he never get tired of questioning me.

"Salty. I couldn't help ... you know, trying to help her. It was my fault I got the authority involved." I could see he found my use of the word authority interesting.

"So you felt like the authority failed you?" again, he made a good question. If only I couldn't sense skepticism in his voice. 

"I wouldn't care if they failed me. They failed her. They harrassed a victim. They tried to spin a narrative that I was complicating their job."

"Astrid, I understand how you feel. I understand you still sense some sort of skepticism in my voice. It's because I'm trying to understand you objectively." Well if I were to be honest, I found this shrink interesting. I realized where he got it wrong. He should've been trying to understand me subjectively. He should've forgot child psychology. He should've forgot his diagnosis tools.

"I believe you're a kind kid. You understand your emotions really well. You only have a good intention. But the justice system we have is a little more complicated." If only complicated was a synonym of 'flawed', I whispered.

"It's not just your school. The situation you encountered is very common. I'd be able to understand the context better if I could talk to the girl and the other children that you said were hurting her." Exactly. You were looking for the missing ring at the place it wasn't lost. How nice would it be if I didn't see his intention. He wasn't searching for the missing ring. He was checking the place where the ring wasn't lost.



Two virologists in Athens call their daughter Angel but she demands to be called Art instead. She can hear colors and see melody. She finds herself to be a fan girl of Homer. She can get used to any instrument in no time. She always runs away from her classes because they're too strict and unimaginative. Her parents' friend therapist, David Lysandra, diagnoses her with Schizotypal Personality Disorder. But she believes her senses are real and the therapist is just less imaginative. One day, she runs away from her home to follow a luminous thread only she can see. It leads her to Atlas City.
