## Chapter I - Stationary Action [Science] (smooth)

"Oh my precious Science, did you just derive Hamilton's Principle," mom said, looking at the whiteboard.

"I'll never understand how such a beautiful mind was conceived inside me. When I was 10, I was dressing up paper dolls. I'll never be as brilliant as you, my dear." I could sense an overwhelming intensity of joy and pride in her voice. She wasn't just looking at a whiteboard filled with mathematical equations. She was looking at my weeks of exhausting work on these mechanics problems. My investigation of the physical world in the language I'm most fluent with.

I felt relieved. I got somewhere finally without getting entangled in specific details. I wasn't pursuing physics like mom; she was a nuclear physicist working at the University of Copenhagen. I was more drawn to the pure beauty of mathematical abstraction. Physics was her passion; mathematics was mine. While she saw the beauty in theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, I was captivated by the elegant magic of describing the universe through pure abstraction. But weren't we approaching the same truth from different sides? Isn't it the beauty of Science, anyway?

"Will you have your dinner now, my baby Science? I made your favourite dish." I could never fully express how much I loved mom. She knew I wouldn't have dinner without getting somewhere. I almost forgot how hungry I was.

Mom called me Science. It was what she loved most in the entire universe. I believed she never hesitated to name me Science; it must have been as if she never considered another word that could describe her love for me. I never knew who my dad was. Neither did my mom. One day, she realized she wanted to give birth to me and contacted her friend at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. She had always known physical intimacy wasn't her way of connecting with others. Throughout her life, she'd had occasional relationships, but maintaining them without getting physical proved challenging. In the end, she chose a path of motherhood that was entirely her own. She ticked 'anonymous donor' in the form, despite her curious mind of a scientist. A mysterious donor giving me the other half of genes seemed more profound than someone she could contact. Who my father was never mattered to me or my mom. There were more than enough problems we could enjoy solving.

I had to bring a textbook to the dinner table. I couldn't wait to compare my derivation with the textbooks. Mom mentioned the exact chapter I needed to look up. I could swear these mathematical symbols danced with an ethereal luminescence before my eyes. I realized I had traced the same beautiful mathematical path others had walked before me. The joy wasn't in being first, but in understanding the universal language that explains the universe.

I remembered how happy mom was when I was more curious about how the ball moved when you threw it rather than playing with it. "Mom, does that boy know how to catch the ball because he can predict its route from the initial configuration?" I remembered she laughed. She gave me Euclid's Elements for my 7th birthday. It was still my favorite book of all time. She taught me physics before I knew who I was. But there was always this skepticism that made me hesitant to intuitively accept physical laws for granted. Why was light refracted this way instead of all the other possible paths? I realized now I understood these phenomena in the most abstract sense human science can explain.

I spent a few more weeks deriving all the other physics principles I knew from one universal principle I just rediscovered; that of stationary action. One day, I decided to send an email to Luna on mom's computer. Before I talked about Luna, I needed to talk about mom's secret work, or at least what I call her secret work. I always hated when mom had to travel to work with her physicist colleagues from Santandería. She often brought me to university conferences, but these foreign colleagues remained a mysterious presence, always kept at a distance from my little world. I never nagged her to take me with her though.

"I'll only be away for four days, my baby Science. Luna will be here to look after you."

She always asked Luna to babysit me. Luna was her graduate student. She was always very kind to me. Unlike other people, she never treated me like I was weird. It never looked like babysitting with her. It was more like a private lecture; except that neither of us would know who was supposed to be the lecturer. I used to ask her a lot of questions that I would've asked mom if she was with me. I thought she might've found them frustrating but she found them fun. It was how Luna realized she could offload her assignments to my little brain. Sometimes my skepticism could help her see something she missed because she took it for granted. She always appreciated my strong sense of rigour in everything.

"For the last time, my sweet Science, Luna is my graduate student. Not yours. Please don't help her with her homework," mom said laughingly. I nodded. I knew it was Luna when I heard the door knock. I ran to help her carry the bags to my mom's room where Luna would stay at. She brought two bags of textbooks.

"Luna, I'll fail your entire assignment if my son solves it for you—and I'll enjoy doing it," mom warned her with a straight face. Luna smiled sheepishly.

"It's okay, mom. These books are for me. I'd like to start studying other sciences for a change," I defended Luna. Luna gestured towards a bag with a subtle nod of her chin, and I unzipped it to reveal the contents to mom. 'The Origin of Species' and a collection of biology texts Luna had borrowed from the university library sat inside. Mom's hand found its way to my head, rubbing it with a mixture of affection and pride. She turned to Luna, expressing her gratitude with a warmth that transcended words.

When her colleagues' car pulled up outside, she bid us both farewell. Luna and I walked her to the car, helping her load her luggage for the trip.

"Have a safe trip, Professor Alma. I'll make sure Science won't do my assignments," said Luna with an attempt to light up the dim moment.

Mom laughed, holding Luna's hand. "Take care of my little scientist," she said, then turned to ruffle my hair. We watched the car move away from us until it was out of our view.

Luna and I went back to my mom's room. I couldn't wait to open Darwin's book. Luna settled into mom's desk chair, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Hey little buddy, what changed your mind suddenly? You always demanded more rigorous equations in my homework than even Professor Alma did. Do you feel like you finished everything you wanted to do with physics?"

I shook my head. "I'm afraid I won't be able to finish working with the secrets of the universe anytime soon. But isn't the fun more about exploring the secrets rather than actually finding them? I feel uncomfortable when I don't find something rigorous. I'm sorry if I've sounded like I'm too demanding. I just don't know how to be comfortable without understanding something rigorously. Thank you for always being patient with me."

"You're welcome, little buddy. I hope you find a fantastic journey with biology. Just let me know whenever you want me to look for more books. Ah, I almost forgot, my friend from the Department of Biology said she's willing to help with anything you find confusing."

I nodded. I grabbed Darwin's book in my arms and went to my bedroom to start reading it.

## Chapter II - Wavelength of Justice [Art] (smooth)

I hated shrinks. They acted like they could fix people like a mechanic would fix an engine. I was not an engine. I was just a creative little brat. The beauty of an engine lies in its mechanical nature while mine lies in organic nature that other organic creatures like my parents failed to grasp. It started with me siding with the girl who was bullied at school. I could tell they had been bullying her for a long time.

"Aria, did you really see them hurting her?" the teacher asked.

I was stunned by their question. How could they possibly doubt the victim? I've always been perceptive, but how blind did they have to be to suspect the victim might be lying? Couldn't they see the obvious scars?

"Please don't tell me I'm the only one who can see the scars," I responded.

The girl looked at me apologetically. She had convinced the teachers it was just an accident. I didn't blame her. It made perfect sense to not expect justice from such teachers. It was clever of her to avoid making her bullies hate her more than they already did. If only it would stop them from bullying her again.

I would never forget their mocking eyes. The shameless teachers not only failed to recognize their moral bankruptcy but also told my parents I was fabricating stories. I wished that were the end of the story, but it wasn't.

"Aria, what's your favourite on the bookshelf?" Mr. David Lysandra asked.

Mr. David was my mom's friend. He was a professor at Atlas University, visiting Athens for a conference. My parents invited him to our home. They said he wanted to get to know me since he heard about me from my mom. He was taking a look at my books, as if I didn't know what he was doing.

"Let me guess. Is it Hesiod?" he said, with his eyes almost begging me for a validation. I nodded since I knew nothing better to do. He was right anyway. He tried to hide his smirk.

"Aria, your mom told me what happened at your school."

Of course, she had to tell her friend what happened. Her crazy little daughter obsessed with mythical tales, making up the tale where she was a hero. What upset me was something else.

"Mr. David, could you call me Art instead, please? I don't like to be called Aria." I interrupted him, trying to sound as polite as I could.

"Of course. Art, I can see that you have a good taste in literature. I admire your personality. I said your mom told me what happened but I don't believe she knew everything."

Of course, he had to try to get inside my head. Of course, he was a shrink. Of course, they asked him for his diagnosis. Of course, I knew something was up. I didn't know why but I agreed to talk to him. I had no intention of proving I was sane. I just saw a faint luminous thread connected to him that apparently nobody else could see.

"I understand you must have your reasons for reporting to the teachers," he continued.

"How long have you known the girl who was hurt?"

I genuinely had no idea how to explain to him. I didn't know the girl or the bullies. They weren't even from my class. I saw her scars and I saw their cruel punchable faces.

"I met her the first time yesterday," I replied honestly.

"Was she already hurt when you met her?" he asked. At least he was more patient than the teachers that dismissed me. I nodded.

"Did she tell you how she got hurt?" he asked, almost sounding like he genuinely cared. I shook my head. She didn't need to speak; her scars told the entire story.

"How did you feel when you saw her hurt, Art?" he asked calmly. I hated his measured tone. I wasn't the one who had been bullied—she was. Why wasn't he treating her instead? Or better yet, why wasn't he treating the bullies?

"Spicy," I answered. Stupid answer for stupid question.

"Elena often told me about your special talent. Have you ever heard of something called synesthesia?"

He seemed determined to get under my skin. Yes, I could hear colors and see songs. Did colorblind people treat others differently just because they perceived colors differently? Basic senses, like touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste, were all just about perceiving waves, and my senses were simply strong enough to perceive them in ways most people couldn't. I didn't see how this had anything to do with my sense of justice.

"Is it when I can smell skepticism in your voice?" I responded, attempting to look respectful. He smiled.

"You have a beautiful mind that perceives the world differently from most people. I think your parents were unnecessarily worried," he said, slowly beginning to make sense.

"Why did you feel like you wanted to tell the teachers about the little girl?"

Again, he was circling back to the start. I hated being interrogated. I hated being diagnosed. If I weren't intrigued by his luminous thread, I wouldn't even be tolerating this talk.

"It was my mistake. I saw no trace of justice in the teachers' eyes. But I reported what I saw anyway, in case I was mistaken. Unfortunately, I wasn't," I explained respectfully.

His eyes brightened with curiosity.

"Were you saying you felt like you already knew the end result?" It was a good question. If only his voice didn't smell of skepticism. I nodded.

"How do you feel knowing you weren't wrong?" He seemed endless in his questioning.

"Salty. I couldn't help trying to help her. It was my fault I got the authorities involved." I noticed his interest in my choice of words.

"So you felt like the authorities failed you?" Another good question. If only I couldn't sense the skepticism in his voice.

"I wouldn't care if they failed me. They failed her. They harassed a victim. They tried to spin a narrative that I was complicating their job."

"Art, I understand how you feel. I know you still sense skepticism in my voice. It's because I'm trying to understand you objectively."

If I were to be honest, I finally found this shrink interesting. I realized where he was mistaken. He should have been trying to understand me subjectively. He should have forgotten child psychology. He should have forgotten his diagnostic tools. He should have unlearned everything he learned.

"I believe you're a kind kid. You understand your emotions well. You have good intentions. But the justice system is a little more complicated."

If only 'complicated' were a synonym for 'flawed', I whispered.

"It's not just your school. This situation is quite common. I'd understand the context better if I could talk to the girl and the other children you said were hurting her."

Exactly. He wasn't looking for the missing ring in the wrong place. How nice it would be if I couldn't see through his intention. He wasn't searching for the missing ring at all in the first place; he was simply examining the wrong place for the wrong reason. I found his approach amusing. I needed to give something witty to someone so completely missing the point.

"What's the difference between a therapist and a lawyer?" I asked him.

"A suit?" he answered, after thinking for a while.

He was funny. I could've been friends with him if he weren't a therapist trying to diagnose me.

"Exactly. Both of them listen to you and then convince you of a truth you can tolerate."

"What do you think is the version of the truth you can live with?" he asked instantly.

"I don't settle for a palatable truth. I expose the failures of authority. One layer at a time," I explained.

I was certain he was impressed. He admitted to admiring my resilience. He went on to reassure my parents about what happened at school. My perception of reality was so intense that it might have been impossible to investigate through conventional facts. I didn't even tell him I saw a luminous thread connected to him. In fact, I told nobody about it. Seeing that nobody seemed to notice it, I knew it was something I should've kept to myself. I never learned the exact details of his conversation with my parents, but somehow they misinterpreted his words, ultimately concluding I was struggling with Schizotypal Personality Disorder.

## Chapter III - Sappho's Lyre [Love] (smooth)

War had always been intimately close to me even when I was in my mom's womb. Ashes, blood and tears, I knew sufferings before I knew my name. I was born tired of all the sufferings in the world.

"How could I know my life would be changed when I interviewed him?" mom said, with a hint of tears in her eyes.

Mom was tending to her lyre. I put my head on the little remaining area of her lap like I always did.

"He had strong hands and sharp eyes. His calm voice shook my heart. My life was dull and lifeless before he came in to it. He gave me a purpose. He gave me Love. He gave me you," she went on. I listened to her with all the care in my heart, even though I've heard the same story more times than I could count. Wasn't I the only thing that was left of him for her?

"Galvarino, your dad," she said softly—her gaze drifting into the abyss, "he was the bravest man I've ever met. Came from the wild blood of Veridia. The same blood that flows in you. No wonder you're so full of courage, Love." She called me Love, the same thing that she called him. Her soft fingers ran through my hair. I sensed so much love flowing from her fingers.

"I wished I were as brave as you and your dad," she confessed with a heavy heart.

I was a daughter of two warriors. While my dad's weapon was a gun and my mom's a pen, my weapon of choice would be a needle. Didn't the world have too much suffering already? I never got a chance to see my dad. He was dead before I was born. Grew up as a fatherless child, all I ever longed for was a safe haven.

I never wanted mom to continue my dad's fight and yet I understood her mission; it was the least she could do in his name. All her life, she had worked hard for the preservation of indigenous languages in the Crescent where the borders of three countries met; one of which was Veridia, where my dad was born and died. Her life was destined to be doomed from the beginning. Perhaps so was mine. I always knew she wouldn't change a thing in her life even if she knew how it would end. I wouldn't change a thing in my life either despite the endless melancholy that followed me everywhere. What a tragedy it was that my two hands would never be enough to heal the world. What a tragedy it was that my two hands would never be enough to heal my mom.

I never told her I could hear the words she left unspoken. I wished I could find a way to ease her despair.

"I'm scared, my Love. I told you I published a paper. But it wasn't just an academic paper. I'm scared, my baby Love. I had to do it. It was the least I could do for the brothers and sisters of your dad that I never met. For the blood of my Love. For the blood of the brave. For the blood of the forgotten. For the blood that still remained. For the blood that is still bleeding. I've put all my heart into my paper. My colleagues that reviewed it didn't have a clue. They helped me release a declaration of war. Of course, I know it wouldn't be enough. Those that took away Galvarino won't stop. I'm not strong enough. Why am I not strong enough? Lord, please spare some mercy for my innocent child if I can't be saved."

She kept her despair locked inside, as if silence could prevent the inevitable, as if it could shield me from feeling the weight of her heart.

I closed my eyes on her lap while she repeated the tales of my dad that she would never get tired of telling.

"Are you asleep, my Love?" she asked softly. I shook my head without opening my eyes.

"Your dad had a strong mind. Nothing terrified him, except for one. It was hilarious. His only weakness was a gay man. He didn't know he was gay. He thought I was in love with him. It was my friend David," she started laughing, almost innocently. Until everything went back to her.

"Love, I need to tell you something important," she continued with a sense of urgency that I hated, "please try to remember this friend's name. His name is David Lysandra. I think he's in Atlas City. In case I was to be assigned to take a work trip suddenly..." she continued, trying her best to hide her shaking voice, "David will look after you. He was there for me when I gave birth to you. He's always been the best, after your dad."

I nodded, without opening my eyes, trying to hide the tears. I knew what was coming. Not because I was a wise child. But because my mom was a wise woman. She knew what was coming. I knew everything she knew. All you needed to do was feel her heartbeat. Feeling everything who you love feel was the least I could do. If only I closed my eyes hard enough. If only I hugged her hard enough. If only I wished hard enough this moment of warmth could last for an eternity.

She faced Death the exact same way the love of her life did. It was said that it was an accident. A stray bullet from a gang war in the neighborhood, in Bogotá. I wished I didn't know better. Why did she arrange everything to move me to Atlas City after her funeral if it was just an accident? Why did she have to live in fear without sharing it with me? Her lyre was the only thing I could take, in memory of her.

## Chapter IV - Barrel Gambit [Politics] (smooth)

I never told my parents I hated chess. Because I loved spending time with them. Dad would spend entire days playing chess with me. It might have been an escape from his career for him. He was a political scientist. He often said chess was the only truly fair game he knew.

The knights were my favorite pieces—ninjas of the chessboard. They could penetrate seemingly impregnable fortresses, often with an intention of not coming back alive. Their mission is sometimes as subtle as supporting a frontline piece from the shadows. If it were up to me, I'd have wanted four knights instead of two knights and two bishops. Of course, it would drain your mental stamina more rapidly to keep track of four knights instead of two.

I never got as good at chess as my dad. I couldn't win a game against him if he weren't intentionally making suboptimal moves; he tried to hide his best but I saw through his act. Did he really think he could fool his son who inherited his tactical intuition?

I remember the tender look in mom's eyes when I questioned the pawn's fate—condemned to a war where they seemed most vulnerable. Dad took it as an opportunity to explain the concept of promotion; which I never quite understood. What difference did it make to become a queen, rook, or knight if you were still trapped in the same war?

What I found most interesting in chess is stalemate. I hated sacrificing pieces. I hated exchanging pieces as if there were a mysterious formula to calculate their values. I hated cornering someone. I hated being cornered. I hated checkmates more than the others. A stalemate is something as bold as Diogenes telling Alexander to stand out of the sun.

My dad used to hate it when I decided to resign too early until I explained to him how I knew I was already lost. Sometimes he was surprised that even he didn't see he was winning himself. I could never quite tell if his surprise was genuine or carefully calculated. He said even though I had very little knowledge of chess opening strategies, my tactical insight surpassed his already because I could see through his moves even better than himself. He must have made a lot of effort to hide it when he was intentionally making a suboptimal move. We kind of invented a new rule; I would win if I could tell he intentionally made a suboptimal move so we could finish dishonest games where he wanted to balance the odds fast and prolong honest exhausting games. Of course it would only work if he wouldn't lie. I never saw my parents lie to me; not just me, they never lied to anyone. But I noticed my dad often pretended to be clueless. I was too young to understand it was a tactical necessity sometimes.

Mom would never pretend. She was the most innocent soul I'd ever known—until I would later meet her who matched mom's pure spirit. Mom was a computer scientist. She introduced me to programming long before I could fully learn to write in a natural language. Together, we programmed a simplified version of chess—a 6x6 board with just 5 pawns, and 2 knights on each side. Oh, how much my dad hated that game. It was where I could beat him without him having to make subtle bad moves. He could try his best and I'd either win or draw. I was only trying to stalemate. He simply failed to avoid mistakes. Even though he never admitted it, I knew he found that very frustrating.

Mom and dad had always been a perfect match in every sense that mattered. They met each other at the University of Vienna. Dad came from a South American country called the Republic of Veridia. He settled here in Vienna with mom. Though he continued fighting for his people through academic discourse, I could sense him drowning in the guilt, thinking he had turned his back on his homeland. Mom had always been a great help to him, providing not only emotional support but also critical data analysis for his research and activism work. They were always remarkably open about their activism. Their colleagues looked alarmed and frightened every time they mentioned it. I always found it so funny how they lowered their voices suddenly, as if someone trying to spy on them wouldn't notice it.

"Why do your friends look so weird everytime you mention politics?" I asked dad once.

"Polis," he said—my parents called me Polis for Politics in short—"it's because they fear being in danger. Many people lost their jobs when they spoke out. Some were even sentenced on political charges. Their fear isn't irrational. But I wouldn't call them my friends. What I'm doing isn't even politics in the traditional sense. I wouldn't even call what I'm doing politics.

"I've told you about my friend Galvarino, right? He was like a brother to me. We protested together, drank together, studied together. He returned to our homeland while I remained here, like a coward. He lost his life fighting for what he believed in Veridia.

"So I can't blame people for their fear either. I never intend to put them in danger by being open about sensitive topics. Nobody would suspect them of collaborating with us. They were never truly in danger. Speaking out is just the least I can do in the name of justice. Actually, it's more convenient to observe their fear. Unlike a game of chess, discussions are often required to see each other's perspective. It's my duty as an activist to constantly declare my stance."

"How do you know the risk you're taking is safe enough?" I asked.

"I don't. I'm not immune to fear. I know the danger better than my colleagues do. But I understand the danger of fear even more profoundly. Let me tell you about Galvarino. The original Galvarino—the warrior my friend was named after. He was a Mapuche warrior who fought against Spanish colonists in South America, during a time when Europeans were ruthlessly colonizing indigenous lands. They captured Galvarino and cut off his hands as a brutal punishment, then released him alongside other prisoners to spread terror. Fear, they believed, was the most effective tool of oppression.

"But Galvarino refused to become an agent of fear. Can you imagine what he did? He fastened knives to his mutilated wrists and continued fighting. Instead of being held back by fear, he inspired his comrades. He transformed his wounds into weapons of resistance.

"Unfortunately," dad continued, his voice heavy with a pain that seemed incurable, "he was eventually caught and executed."

I saw my admiration for Galvarino reflected in dad's eyes. I knew he carried the same reverence for both the historical warrior and his namesake friend.

"The battlegrounds might have changed," dad said, "but the spirit of resistance remains the same. Politics is like a more complicated game of chess, Polis. To let fear control you is to trap your pieces yourself. But overcoming fear doesn't guarantee an advantage either. You must maneuver with precision and purpose. We don't speak out merely to endanger ourselves—our activism is both a shield and a sword. A move that's both attacking and defensive. Our visibility as known activists offers a form of protection. We forge connections with allies and, equally important, we identify those who stand against justice. Chess is just a simplified metaphor for the complex strategies of life. Polis, I always knew you hated chess. I needed you to be prepared with that mode of thinking. Understanding the purpose behind the moves is a necessary step in the fight for justice. I wished you wouldn't hate me for asking you to endure chess."

I shook my head. Why would I hate him for that? Wasn't he the one who taught me to see the difference between the pieces, the hand moving the pieces and the meaning of the moves? Of course, I understood what he wanted me to see. Not that it made me hate chess any less, though.

## Chapter V - Shield of Silence [Science] (smooth)

Mom followed her hero, Marie Curie, in more ways than one. I was 12 when she was first diagnosed with radiation sickness. It got worse and worse since then. You would've thought scientists would no longer be in such a risk with the advancement of technology and safety measurements. Despite knowing something lurked beneath the surface, the silence between us—mom, Luna, and I—was heavy. What if my worst fears wouldn't come true if I pretended it wasn't real?

Luna promised mom, on her dying bed, she would take care of me.

Luna's family took me in as her foster brother, into their farmhouse on the outskirts of Copenhagen. They gave me her brother's old room in the attic—a cozy, trapezium-shaped space under the slant of the red brick roof. The wooden floorboards creaked a familiar path from the bed to the small window, which looked out over a yellowish-green field that seemed to stretch forever. For months, I’d wake up each morning disoriented, my hand reaching for a light switch that wasn't on the right wall and my heart aching for the familiar crack in the ceiling of my old bedroom. Euclid's Elements was the only relic from the past that I brought to my new home.

Luna's family found it weird that my name was Science—a constant reminder of an identity that no longer felt like myself. They preferred to call me Alma's child. Apart from Luna, I could barely talk to anyone. Luna continued to homeschool me just like my mom did, though we still didn't know who was teaching whom. The more I buried my face in books, the more foreign the world of human interaction.

I would always be grateful to Luna for bringing me hundreds of books from the library. At least I didn't need to send her an email anymore. Not knowing how to cope with the loss of my mom, I punished myself by studying the fields I would never have considered before. Computer Science, Data Science, Forensic Science—each discipline became a shield, a way to keep me at a distance from my grief. I wasn't trying to find evidence of my mom's death being orchestrated. In truth, I was terrified of what such evidence might reveal. It was a puzzle I never wanted to solve. If mom had been in danger, was Luna also in danger? How could I protect her if I couldn't even talk to a stranger? I often locked myself in the room, pretending I was a plant; hoping in case of a further tragedy, nothing would hold me accountable. The deeper I dived into unfamiliar subjects, the more I could forget my life.

Luna often offered to take me when she went out with her friends for a change of scenery. I always declined except for the first time. Her friends were really kind, their friendliness creating no pressure, demanding no expectation. Still, I felt perpetually uncomfortable around new people. Luna's parents, despite treating me as their own child, remained strangers to me. I would eat, sleep, read, and retreat—a parasitic ghost inhabiting their home. The guilt of my silence never left me, a constant reminder of my inability to connect.

Luna helped me connect with incredible professors from universities worldwide. Scholarships were just an application away. I didn't know why I never submitted one. One day, I realized contacting professors might have been a mistake. As much as it pained me, I had to detach myself from Alma Kristensen—the nuclear physicist who gave me life. I needed to protect Luna. Invisibility became my shield, the shadows my sanctuary.

Luna came to my room to give me some books, a routine we'd maintained for years. Seven years had passed since I first arrived at their farmhouse. She was now an assistant professor at my mother's former department. Before I opened my mouth, I sensed she knew this conversation was long coming.

"Luna," I said softly, "I know you still see me as your innocent little brother. I'm grateful for everything you've done for me. But I'm 20 now. I think it's time I explore the world on my own."

After a moment's hesitation, she agreed.

"Can I use mom's retirement funds?" I asked reluctantly.

Luna nodded without hesitation. "Of course, it's yours. I'm not worried about the money," she said, her concern evident. "I'm worried about something else. You know... it's hard to talk to people. I could help you, speak for you at my department."

Luna hoped I would follow her academic path, but I was determined to forge my own. When she offered to pull strings and enroll me in her class, I refused firmly. My reasons ran deeper than a simple desire to try something new—I needed to protect her. Alma Kristensen's legacy was a potential danger, and the less connection Luna had to me, the safer she would be. I explained my need for anonymity, to leave no traceable paperwork. The attic had been my sanctuary, and now the indifferent world would become my refuge.

"Trust me, Luna" I pleaded softly. "You've taught me everything I need to know. I'll be okay. The less I talk, the easier I can remain a ghost. It's meant to be my protection."

I couldn't be more explicit than this. The words for my deepest fears remained trapped behind my lips—to voice them would only sound like madness. We just looked at each other in silence. I thanked God Luna understood without words. She'd seen the same shadows I had, felt the same hidden danger that ran beneath the surface of my mother's illness. Wasn't our silence itself a form of mutual protection?

Despite her irrepressible worries, she eventually accepted my new journey. She crafted reasonable explanations for her parents, who wished me the best. I spent my final days basking in their warmth, unaware of how deeply I would miss this second home.

## Chapter VI - Red Horse [Politics] (smooth)

"Why did you fight again?" Sister Cecilia asked, tending to the wounds in my face. Her voice was trembling with worry and maternal concern.

I kept silent as usual. Despite the cold sting of rubbing alcohol, I found comfort in the softness of her fingers—gentle against my bruised skin. She was a pale, weathered Sister who had mothered hundreds of children like me, her life dedicated to serving what she believed was God's duty. She was the only face I found warm at St. Matthew. I didn't get along with Father Gabriel; we had theological differences.

"Polis, I told you to let me know when they bully you again," Sister Cecilia complained. I felt a mixture of frustration and concern in her exhausted voice. I nodded as a silent acknowledgment of my failure. I wanted to apologize, but the words caught in my throat. How does one apologize when they don't even understand what they did wrong?

Once the fight started, the fight started. They had always harassed me—calling me gay because I was weak and feminine, because I failed to fit their definition of masculinity. "Your parents died because you're a disgrace," they'd sneer. As if my own grief wasn't terrible enough. There was no place for me in their realm of God, they said. They were annoyed by my mere existence. As if I wasn't annoyed by my own existence either.

Why couldn't they be satisfied with their senseless insults? Instead, they had to violate even my smallest comfort. They snatched the Bible from my hands, a book that wasn't even mine. I would've let them get away with it if it wasn't my only sanctuary—God's words were the only thing that could momentarily distract me from the weight of my own existence. When I politely pleaded to return it, they taunted me to take it back from them. When I did exactly what they wanted me to do, they responded with the only language they knew—violence. They pushed me, as if my willingness to forgive was an invitation to bully. When I pushed back, they assumed it was a divine permission to beat me. I knew I couldn't win. But in that moment, I thought of Galvarino—the warrior who transformed his wounds into weapons of resistance. How could I explain this to Sister Cecilia? I had already lost everything. Why would I mind a few more scars on my face? To let fear rule me would be the ultimate betrayal to my parents.

"I scolded them," Sister Cecilia said, her voice balancing between solace and vigilance. "I told them to be kind, or they will see my wrath." She looked at me, her eyes softening. "Please take care of yourself. Don't let anger consume you. I know you're a good kid, Polis."

"Thank you for your kindness, Sister," I responded, my voice quiet but sincere. "I won't let it happen again." A sudden thought struck me. "Can I get another Bible, Sister?" How would I survive here without the soothing verses?

"Of course," she replied, her movements gentle as she walked to the library. Moments later, she returned with another Bible. I felt bad about the torn remnants of the previous one.

I returned to the dormitory, hugging the book close to my chest. I felt their angry eyes still burned into my back, a never-ending weight of unresolved malice. Why were they still furious? I was the one that got beaten. I failed to land a real blow on their shameless faces. Weren't they scolded for what they did out of their own will? What satisfaction could they possibly get from endless anger?

They laughed behind my back. "He doesn't know," I heard them mutter. I didn't know what I didn't know. There is no new thing under the sun.

Ever since my parents died in an accident, fear had become my constant companion. St. Matthew was never a home—just a place of perpetual unease. Sister Cecilia remained my sole comfort, but even her vigilance couldn't shield me from everything. Father Gabriel could have been an ally, but I made the foolish mistake of arguing with him. The bullies feared Father Gabriel more than Sister Cecilia.

When I reached my bed, I started reading the Book of Revelations again. The Horsemen gave me countless nightmares and sleepless nights. Confronting these spectral fears was my only known strategy of survival. Weren't my tormentors the true worshipers of the Horsemen after all? Unlike the other children who surrendered, I refused to acknowledge their dominion. I rejected Conquest's White Horse. War, on the Red Horse, was my weakness. They always succeeded in provoking me. I was always the one that got beaten. But I never submitted. For it would be a betrayal to the spirit of Galvarino. I drifted into an uneasy sleep with the Bible verses floating around me.

A rook piece striking my head disrupted my sleep. Not again. The pain in my forehead meant nothing; their mocking laughter even less. They had stolen my dad's chess set—the only thing I brought from my home, my sole reminder of the happy days. Just when I decided not to be provoked, they struck at my most vulnerable point. They knew there was nothing I hated more than losing my chess set. I tried to calm myself. I put the Bible on the pillow carefully. Should I wake up Sister Cecilia, in the middle of the night? What if they lost some pieces before Sister Cecilia could resolve this? I always felt like I lost everything again when they stole the chess set.

I had a panic attack again. I prayed for guidance from the souls of my parents. I promised Sister Cecilia I wouldn't let it happen again. A pawn piece landed near my bed, each impact blurring my vision. Overwhelming anxiety was blocking my throat. I scrambled to collect the pieces, each one a fragment of a life now lost. I should've submitted. I should've let them win. They would never stop until I gave in. I should've let them become the masters of the ward. It was a cost too high—these chess pieces were my last connection to moments of joy. I wished it was just a nightmare.

"Please," I begged, "I'll let you hit me if you give them back." My words dissolved into their cruel laughter. They threw piece after piece, treating me like a game, enjoying my desperation. I wished everything was just a nightmare and I was still in my bed at my home. I knew it wasn't a nightmare. Another piece hit my head. I could feel bleeding on my forehead. "Please," I begged again, rubbing the blood with the back of my hand.

It got louder and louder. They were throwing the pieces harder and harder. Other children stirred but remained in their beds, paralyzed by fear. I gathered each piece, ignoring the blood, hoping they would exhaust their malice eventually. I told myself everything would be okay. All I had to do was to give the chess set to Sister Cecilia afterward for safekeeping. It would be over soon.

They got what they wanted when the knight piece struck the wall. I knew the sound was different. I ran to find the piece under the bed; the tip of the knight broken. The white horse piece looked dark and bloody in my hand. I knew I promised Sister Cecilia it wouldn't happen again. I knew I would be beaten again if I fought back. I knew it wouldn't fix the broken chess piece.

But in that moment, War on his Red Horse, consumed me completely. I ran towards them, keeping my bloody fists tight in a declaration of resistance.

## Chapter VII - Vanishing Wand [Art] (smooth)

Ever since Mr. David's diagnosis, my parents seemed to have found their justification for treating me like I was unstable. I didn't want to accuse them of irrational prejudice—they were pathologists, after all. Identifying and categorizing was literally their professional language. I knew this would happen the moment Mr. David started talking to me. He might not have been a bad therapist, but he'd handed my parents exactly what they wanted: a convenient label. I saw the relief in their eyes. Not the relief of understanding, but the relief of having a convenient explanation for everything they couldn't comprehend about me. A label that would absolve them from truly listening, from seeing me as I am.

"She has Schizotypal Personality Disorder," they would whisper to relatives, their voices carrying hints of concern and a strange pride - as if diagnosing me proved their medical expertise more than their parental understanding. They thought they were educated, progressive people who could "parent" a troubled child. They tended to use big words to mask they failed to comprehend their own daughter. They had a kind child who only wanted to do good, and somehow, they managed to make everything complicated.

I felt like an outsider in my own home. Dad's jokes weren't just lame; they were cheap weapons of dismissal. Each time he made a comment about my "magical thinking," I could see he wasn't trying to connect - he was trying to categorize, to normalize me into the narrow box of his understanding. Mom would smile sympathetically, believing her gentle tone masked her fundamental lack of comprehension. "We just want to help you understand the world, Aria" she'd say, not realizing I understood the world far more deeply than they ever could.

When the magic tour, "Kaspar's Traveling Illusions", arrived in our neighborhood, I saw my chance—to refuse to be defined by their limited perception. Every adult who looked at me and saw a "problem" to be solved was another brick in the wall I was determined to break through. I saw my home in those who they called freaks. For the first time, I knew what I had to do.

Dad's whispered comments didn't escape me, even when he thought they did.

"She's already living in a magical realm," he muttered to mom, with a mix of concern and mockery that he found clever. "Are you sure it's okay to take her to a magic show?"

"It's just a show. Can you be a little easy on Aria... She's just an innocent child that has a little trouble with different realities," mom explained. She might have thought she was being considerate.

"Exactly. When she sees these freaks, she'll believe everything they show is real and we'll have to deal with a whole series of her 'imaginations' later."

It went on and on. When mom finally got permission to take me to the show, I surprised them both. "I'd rather stay home and read," I said, a small act of defiance that I would regret the rest of my life. While dad looked more relieved that I declined, mom still tried to persuade me to see the show with her. In that moment, I saw her genuine excitement, her hope of sharing something magical with me—and I shut her down. How much I wished I just listened to her instead of what I ended up doing—a hidden card up my sleeve.

On the last day of the magic tour, before dawn could break, I packed my possessions—Hesiod's books and a change of clothes—and slipped out the window. One last look at my room, a space that had never truly felt like mine. I wasn't running from home. I was running towards the first opportunity to prove that my way of seeing the world wasn't a disorder—it was my strength.

The magic tour's camp was my destination. My new life was about to begin.

That day, I found two people who felt more like family than my own parents ever had. I was running errands at the market when I first noticed her—an old woman tending a flower shop, someone I'd never seen before. There was something about her, a warmth that seemed to radiate beyond the buckets of colorful blooms. She was singing a lullaby that pulled me into its gentle current, its melody so whimsical that I momentarily forgot my mundane chores.

I was gathering groceries when I spotted him: a boy around my age, standing with the traveling crew. He looked different—not just in appearance, but in a way that made my senses tingle. The same luminous thread I'd seen connected to Mr. David now connected to him, invisible to everyone but me. It was even far stronger. It was beyond me how nobody else seemed to notice it.

"Are you with the crew?" The words tumbled out before I could stop myself.

He looked me up and down, sizing me up, then gave a slight nod, slowly. Why did it take him so long?

"I'm Art. What's your name?" I said, extending my hand in a gesture of introduction.

"My name is Polis," he replied in English, a shy Germanic accent coloring his words. Of course—the crew was international.

"How long have you been with the crew?" I asked in English.

"Just a couple of months," he replied, then quickly turned the conversation. "Excuse me, why are you asking?"

I didn't miss a beat. "I want to join your crew."

A flicker of judgment crossed his face. "You don't look like an orphan."

It annoyed me. "What does that have to do with anything?"

Polis explained patiently, "Kaspar would love to welcome new talents. But sometimes it can be complicated for someone who isn't an orphan. This isn't a part-time job—you'd have to fully commit to the tour."

"That's exactly what I want," I said, my determination cutting through his concerns.

"Will your parents approve?" he challenged.

"It's my decision," I countered, leaving no room for argument.

He softened slightly, sharing his own story. "I'm an orphan. The crew visited St. Matthew—my orphanage—once. I impressed Kaspar with my chess skills. But I still needed permission from Sister Cecilia."

I saw my opening. "Can you please arrange a meeting with Kaspar?"

"He's free now," Polis said, with a mixture of curiosity and reluctance in his voice.

I paused. "Wait—does he understand Greek?"

A shake of the head.

"But English?"

He nodded. I gestured I was ready. He then led me to a weathered tent at the edge of the crew's camp, its canvas faded but still sturdy.

Kaspar was exactly as I'd imagined—a lean man with a distinctive mustache who looked more like a character from an old traveling circus than a modern performer. I knew I had to impress him quickly. I chose my strongest talent. Clearing my throat, I began to sing a traditional Greek lullaby, its melody soft and haunting—the same one I'd heard the old florist woman singing earlier that day.

"What is your name, little girl?" Kaspar asked, his English rough with a thick Germanic accent.

I didn't hesitate. "Acanthia. Acanthia Andriades."

"Who do you live with?" Kaspar probed.

"With my elders," I replied smoothly. Weren't my parents my elders after all?

"Will they be okay with you joining? This could take a year or more."

I had to paint a picture of a supportive grandmother. "Yia-yia would love for me to gain new experiences. I think she might have explored the world with a crew when she was young."

"Can I meet her?" he asked.

"Yes. Can you please give me twenty minutes?" I said, already formulating my plan.

The walk back to the flower shop was a careful game of manipulation and genuine connection in my head. I wove my story with the precision of a clever hero in a tale, each word calculated yet seemingly spontaneous.

"Hello, Yia-yia. My name is Acanthia. Have you seen the magician crew in town? I just came from them. I'm an Athenian and this is my hometown. I was talking to the foreigner in the crew about Acanthus. The one that my own name originated from. I said Acanthus kept the buildings safe from evil spirits but he was skeptical about it. Yia-yia, you look like a wise lady that he would listen to. Can you help me explain them about Acanthus flower?"

The old woman's eyes sparkled with the kind of wisdom that comes from generations of storytelling.

"Oh, little child," she said, in her warm voice stained with an unnecessary sorriness, "I couldn't speak a word in the foreigner's tongue."

"It's okay, Yia-yia," I reassured her. "I'll translate. I'm just not as good as explaining in detail myself."

The old lady agreed to help me. She asked her neighbor shopkeeper to keep watch on her stall and followed me. I could sense her eagerness to share her knowledge, her loneliness finding a momentary companion in me.

"Yia-yia, you look like you know everything about flowers. How long have you been selling flowers here?" I tried to make a conversation while walking.

"Oh, my little grandchild," she started with a voice covered by grief, "I restarted selling at the market just today. I left my hometown decades ago to live with my son. But he passed away last week. My daughter-in-law is a great lady but it was too sad for an old woman to be constantly reminded of her son's absence. So I decided to come back to my hometown. I restarted what I did before he found his wife."

I comforted her as much as I could. A part of me felt bad for taking advantage of her kindness, but another part knew this was my only way out. I learned that her son had left two daughters.

When we reached the tents, I introduced her to Kaspar. He asked how we were related, and I told him she had two granddaughters and I wasn't the elder one as if I didn't know how to say younger in English. Yia-yia did the rest.

"Were the flower engravings in the columns of the building Acanthus?" I asked her. She nodded passionately, launching into tales about the flower. Kaspar nodded politely, understanding nothing. Polis gave me a knowing look but kept silent. Kaspar was convinced that my grandmother wanted me to join the crew. He began discussing my potential salary.

I knew exactly how to keep her talking—I simply asked about her flowers. All I had to do was mention flowers, and she would speak from her heart.

Finally convinced, Kaspar requested a signed approval and some ID documents. I thanked her, seeing the radiating happiness in her eyes. I told her I had paperwork to complete and would take her back to her shop. Instead of the groceries my mom wanted, I bought a lot of Acanthus flowers. She thanked me endlessly. I told her to thank the foreigner instead.

Back home, mom was surprised to see Acanthus flowers and a lot of missing items from the groceries list. In my bedroom, Acanthia became a master forger. I signed the approval letter in an imitation of an elderly handwriting. I edited my national ID card—these foreigners weren't used to seeing a Greek ID every day, so it didn't need to be perfect. I returned to Kaspar with my documents. I even took him to the old grandma's flower shop to show him my hometown. She was so genuinely happy to thank the foreigner that I felt guilty for my trick.

And that was how I tricked the great magician Kaspar into taking me in. With a crew of European travelers touring around European countries, border crossings would be simple. Greek law enforcement was looking for Aria Selas, the missing child of Elena and Dimitris Selas. How could they possibly know that Aria had transformed into Acanthia Andriades like a vanishing wand turning into a flower?

## Chapter VIII - Renegades [Politics] (smooth)

"Why do you keep reading the Bible?" Art asked, without a hint of worry in her voice. In St. Matthew, such a question would have felt like a trap, an invitation to an unnecessary fight. But I knew her now—her curiosity was genuine, free of any hidden malice.

"The same reason you brought Hesiod," I answered—recalling the good faith of Sister Cecilia. She nodded.

"Why do you think I brought Hesiod?" she continued to test me. I wanted to give a cyclic answer but I thought better of it.

"Certain items can work as a connection to something we cherish," I answered patiently.

"Like a magical thread," she muttered. I nodded in silent acknowledgment.

I never asked her why she ran away from her home—home was a luxury I could no longer afford, no matter how desperately I wished. Yet she explained it to me anyway—perhaps she felt like she owed me an explanation. She knew exactly what she had to do once she saw a luminous thread connected to me. I admired her intuitive understanding, how she knew I wouldn't find her perception strange or meet it with skepticism.

She had become the most magical element of "Kaspar's Traveling Illusions". Since her arrival, the crew felt more like home than ever before. She was family to me—more so than even Sister Cecilia. My parents might have survived if they possessed half her cleverness. Mom would have adored her; Dad would have feared her. Inheriting both their spirits, I simultaneously loved and feared her.

I was the only one who called her Art; to everyone else, she was Acanthia. Nobody could see through her magic tricks as I could. To the world, she was just a singer, her voice her sole magical instrument. While I worked as an apprentice to the Engineer, she worked alongside the Soubrette, Kaspar's partner. A part of me knew she would have been a superior apprentice to the Engineer. Her ability to forge documents effortlessly never failed to amaze me. She was even a greater magician than Kaspar—how else could she summon documents proving her identity as Acanthia Andriades out of thin air?

"Grrraaaaawwwwrrrr," she roared, wearing the Tiger mask of Tingxuan. Tingxuan, the Chinese acrobat who had recently joined our crew, had been teaching me basic acrobatic skills.

I smiled and patted her like a playful kitten. She mimicked a cat's movements with her hands, and we dissolved into laughter. The shadow of the Tiger mask was cast on the tent canvas. Suddenly, her playful demeanor shifted, and I recognized the serious look that replaced her earlier worry-free eyes.

"Polis, do you think my parents were right? How they interpreted Mr. David's diagnosis..." she asked. I always knew it wasn't without regrets that she left her home.

"Father Gabriel said the same truth could manifest in more than one interpretation," I explained, "you can see different shadows of the same mask depending on the angle of light."

"Did you just explained Plato's cave to an Athenian?" she replied. I smiled, admitting she got me.

"You would see the same shadow from different forms—like a cone and a coin—when placed at a specific angle," I elaborated. She nodded.

"So I might actually have the mental condition my parents diagnosed. But that doesn't mean my perception isn't reliable," she continued. I nodded in agreement.

"Shadows are sometimes the only glimpse of truth we're allowed to witness," I responded.

"Why I keep reading the Bible," I started a new thread of thoughts, "is more than a connection to Sister Cecilia's memory. It's something darker and more dubious." Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. "In its pages, I saw those that took my parents away. Not exactly the specific people responsible, but the entities whose shadows were the puppets that pulled the strings connected to the accident. I recognized their true forms in the Horsemen. The bullies at St. Matthew seemed to worship these same spectral forces. I suspect even your parents' misunderstanding was rooted in these shadowy influences."

"I'll join in your crusade," Art promised. Her declaration was an act of acknowledging our shared bond. She knew she was my family now, as much a comrade as my parents had ever been. I could see her mind already in progress of crafting something meaningful.

"The Knights of Kindness," she continued, "we should name ourselves. The Knights of Kindness are the divine foes of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse." I recalled the chess pieces in my wooden box—I collected them all back, the broken knight painstakingly glued back together. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

"Let me show you something," I said, opening the box to reveal its hidden contents; a sprawling web of cropped newspaper clippings and printed documents laid before her, tracing back to the tragic accident in Vienna—the deaths of Rafael and Sophie Weber, my parents. Every scrap was meticulously collected: details about the driver, police reports, forensic autopsy notes. An intricate information tree branched out from that single devastating event. If only I had more information.

Art began sorting through the papers, her fingers moving with a purpose. "I see a faint luminance in these documents," she explained, her intuition cutting through the chaos without needing any justification. I nodded, recognizing her unique perception.

She was onto something—I could feel it. While I knew some pieces of information held more weight than others, I couldn't risk discarding anything. If only I had access to a computer, to the internet. I knew I was far from uncovering the truth. Yet with Art on my side, I knew whoever was behind my parents' death stood no chance against us.

"Did the Bible foretell our coming, the coming of the Knights of Kindness?" she asked, her eyes emitting a blend of playfulness and genuine curiosity. I wasn't entirely sure if it was a rhetorical question.

I shook my head. "Knighthood didn't exist by the time the Bible was written."

She remarked with a wry smile, "That's why I read Hesiod instead."

"Did Hesiod foretell our coming?" I poked her back.

"No," she responded. "Hesiod didn't foretell anything. Hesiod isn't the beginning and the end. He wrote the poems to reveal the true forms of shadows. Hesiod was a better therapist than Mr. David—he understood the nature of humanity far better than the Bible writers did." For someone swimming in a whimsical realm, she could be remarkably grounded at times. I nodded.

"I want to read Hesiod in the original language. Will you teach me Greek?" I requested again, admitting my Greek was limited to just a few words. She shook her head definitively.

"You chose Tingxuan to be your master. Learn acrobatics first. Don't disappoint multiple teachers at once." I knew she was still nursing a slight grudge that I'd selected a newcomer as my instructor instead of her. How could someone be simultaneously so mature and so childish? I knew begging would be futile. Just like at St. Matthew, where begging never worked—only fists did. If only I'd known some acrobatic skills back then.

I found myself pondering the intricate threads of Fate. Had some grand design orchestrated my loss, ensuring I was at St. Matthew when Kaspar's crew arrived? That I would be in Athens precisely when Art needed to escape her home? Were we truly meant to be the renegades?

## Chapter IX - Sunset in Pink Spectrum [Science] (smooth)

I never stayed at a place more than a semester. It was something deliberate; a dispersion designed to create confusion. Each university became a node in an elaborate algorithm of distraction. I occasionally made ephemeral connections—colleagues who would forget me as quickly as I would forget them. I could have easily joined a doctorate program, but what would be the point? Didn't radiation kill Dr. Alma Kristensen despite her brilliant work? Leaving a trail of breadcrumbs that led nowhere was my intention, a cheap strategy of obfuscation. If I couldn't identify the threat, I would at least make myself difficult to track.

Of many different universities I've been to, Atlas University campus, located on the western beach of Lago Iluna, was the only where I felt like I belong. Atlas City, the capital of the Serene Republic of Altaria, was a home to an intriguing ecosystem of flora—dendrology was always more predictable than human interactions. Altarian people provided a perfect environment for someone like me. Their smiles were warm yet withered; I never felt comfortable around energetic people. They maintained a sweet balance of detachment and helpfulness—neither intrusive nor indifferent. For someone who struggled to simulate feelings, I sensed this city was in harmony with my emotional frequency. No matter which different turns I took, I knew I would always end up here.

Professor Alexei Volkov was a strange man. In fact, wasn't his class, "PL 420: The Ontology of Social Systems," the very reason why I decided to join Atlas University? Perhaps I expected too much. His lectures never quite met my rigorous standards. I always ended up having an argument with him in his class. His insight was always onto something but never quite right. Yet I genuinely enjoyed attending his class. His awkward gestures made me feel belonged. I knew mom would've liked him. Luna would've liked him, too. Wasn't he the catalyst that led me to her?

I didn't know her name for the first couple of weeks. She was the enigmatic girl who was apparently obsessed with strawberry pink—every item she owned, from her shirt to her umbrella, from her books to her phone cover, emitting this specific range of wavelengths of light, that we called pink. She was even taller and stronger than me. Even someone as socially clueless as me could notice how people found such a girl with a masculine physique, surrounded by such a soft color, a contradiction to stereotypes. From the first moment I saw her, I sensed she was extraordinary. If only social interactions came as easily to me as analytical thinking.

Every time I argued with Professor Alexei, she was there to defend him, as if he were incapable of defending himself. I always despised those who defended authority, but I never despised her. Eventually, I realized I was closest to being the authority in PL 420, since I was the one who demanded an unprecedented level of philosophical rigor in a typical final-year undergraduate class.

Walking around Lake Iluna, I found her sitting at the bar overlooking the lake. Behind her, the golden hour magic painted the sky, the bleeding sun casting its reflection across the lake's surface. Typically, I would have been studying in my dorm, but something—perhaps an inexplicable impulse—had drawn me out that day. In her eyes, fixed on the distant horizon, I sensed a melancholic dread that mirrored my own.

My social anxiety threatened to paralyze me again, creating an invisible field of barrier. I genuinely had no idea how to start a conversation. Despite the cinematically romantic scene, I knew my intentions were purely platonic—I simply wanted to be a friend. Cautiously, I approached the table, fully aware of my shy and clumsy steps. The sunset transformed Lake Iluna into a canvas of molten gold, but my focus was entirely on not tripping. She remained absorbed in her thoughts, seemingly unaware of my approach.

"This seat taken?" The words came out more abrupt than intended.

A few seconds passed before she glanced up. I noticed her pink umbrella casting a soft glow. A brief nod—invitation or dismissal, I couldn't tell. I sat, acutely aware of my friendly smile likely appearing more like a grimace. Internally, I was spiraling—how could I explain my purely platonic intentions without sounding predatory? My knees trembled while my heart was pumping fast. Mercifully, she returned her attention to the waves, sparing me from my own awkwardness.

The waitress arrived like a savior, temporarily giving a break to my anxiety. I ordered a lemon tea, grateful for the momentary distraction. The sunset over Lake Iluna was breathtaking—a canvas of gold and crimson. Yet, somehow, her silhouette against that backdrop seemed more pleasantly breathtaking. The moment our eyes met, my embarrassment peaked.

"What do you want?" she asked bluntly.

"I'm sorry," I apologized, in a trembling voice , "I'm sorry for acting like a jerk in the class." She nodded in agreement, almost heartlessly.

"I'm sorry... if I'm interrupting your moment of solitude," I added, my fingers nervously tracing the table corner. She nodded again. I wanted her to tell me it was okay but she didn't. We had a silent moment of pure awkwardness until the waitress brought me a glass of lemon tea. I thanked the waitress.

"I don't know what's wrong with me," I muttered, more to myself than to her. She nodded again. I wished she didn't. I wished I hadn't been such a jerk in the class.

"My name is Science," I introduced myself, then immediately regretted the abruptness. Why did I have to make everything so awkward? I thought I was already used to painful embarrassments. It would have been so nice if she introduced herself but she didn't. She just kept looking at the moving waves.

Desperate to fill the silence, the historical trivia bubbled up before I could stop myself. "Did you know pink was originally a masculine color? It was considered a watered-down red—the color of war. Baby boys used to wear pink before marketing changed everything," my autism spoke for itself. Why did I say it? I already sounded like a creep, didn't I? I hoped, at least, this clarified that I wasn't trying to hit on her. I had no wit required to save myself from this pit.

"I never wanted to be masculine," she said softly, her gaze still fixed on the waves. "I hated my body. I hated how I looked. I just wanted to be a beautiful princess." A pause. "I surround myself with pink because girls look so beautiful in it. But apparently, I'm not one of them."

"You look beautiful in pink," slipped out before I could filter my thoughts. Immediately, I wanted to disappear. Yes, I just officially labelled myself as a creep, didn't I? I knew she wouldn't be grateful for it. She must have thought either I was lying or I assumed she was baiting for a compliment. How should I explain I meant it genuinely without sounding more like a creep? The awkward silence came back. The sun sank into Lake Iluna, darkness spreading like ink. Streetlamps flickered to life, casting soft shadows. There was no moon in the sky. I wished Luna was here to navigate this social minefield.

"I suppose you wouldn't really want to be a jerk either—just like I never wanted to be a manly girl," she said, breaking the silence with an unexpected note of vulnerability. It was my turn to nod.

"I didn't want to do anything with you," she continued. "I just couldn't help defending Professor Alexei. He's obviously on the spectrum—someone needed to stand up for him."

So was I. Why did she have to be so kind to one and so cruel to another?

"I never mean to humiliate anyone," I replied, "Sometimes I just can't help diving into discussions when something feels intellectually incomplete. I'm also on the spectrum myself."

"No shit, Sherlock," she muttered, but this time the words felt more like a connection than a dismissal. Her pink drink vanished in one swift gulp.

"I'm not the one you confronted in class," she said, with a hint of recollection in her voice. "Why did you apologize to me instead of Professor Alexei?"

"I believe Professor Alexei would appreciate our dialogues," I explained. "They were Socratic in essence"

"Are you saying I was unnecessarily sensitive?" she challenged. Even I wouldn't miss her eyebrows.

"Not at all," I replied immediately. "I'd welcome someone helping me refine my arguments. In fact, constructive feedback made our dialogues less... awkward."

"I can't imagine how insufferable you'd be without social anxiety," she complained. I deserved it.

"Welcome to my internal monologue," I confessed with a slight, self-deprecating smile. "Unfiltered thoughts, unrestrained by social frictions."

"I suppose it must be exhausting," she said, her tone softening with an unexpected sympathy. I nodded.

"My name is Seraphine," she introduced herself, and then continued with a hint of challenge in her tone. "What kind of name is Science? I mean no offense, but who names their child Science?"

"A scientist who loved her work more than anything else," I replied, a memory of my mother's heart-warming smile crossing my mind.

"I'm sorry," she backtracked, "I didn't mean to be insensitive. It's just... unusual."

"Actually, most people never learn my name," I explained. "Social anxiety ensures I rarely introduce myself. Even paperwork interactions are minimal—I have my ID anyway, don't I? Nobody usually want anything to do with someone like me either."

"I'm sorry for being rude," she apologized. I felt her earlier defensiveness melting away. "I suppose I was projecting my own insecurities onto you. I understand you never meant to be difficult."

"It's okay," I assured her, sensing a tender shift in our interaction.

"Do you have a last name?" she asked, with a hint of invitation for a genuine friendship.

"Science Kristensen," I replied. "My mother was Alma Kristensen."

"Ah, that explains the Scandinavian accent," she nodded. "I'm Seraphine Clair. My father, Arthur Clair, used to be Professor Alexei's mentor. They worked together for a decade."

"That explains your dedication to defending him," I said, finally understanding the deeper context.

"I suppose it does," she agreed, with a subtle smile that finally made me feel comfortable.

I realized sometimes you would have to touch the grass for the beginning of a beautiful friendship, that no books could offer. I believed the stars in the moonless sky smiled upon us.

## Chapter X - Stairwell of Sorrow [Love] (smooth)

Just two more months of these soul-crushing Infectious Disease lectures, and I’d officially be a doctor. Personally I found the material—viral pathogenesis, outbreak epidemiology—quite fascinating. But our teacher, while a brilliant diagnostician on the wards, had the vocal monotone of a faulty EKG machine. The entire class was united in a shared, caffeine-fueled stupor. If only we’d known how important these lectures would be in the coming storm in the next few years.

I left the lecture hall as soon as it was over. Walking along the corridor, I recalled something. Of course, the elevators would be packed during the shift change, students, nurses, patients' families all squeezed together. I couldn't bear the claustrophobic emotions that would flood me in such tight spaces. The stairs offered a quiet sanctuary, a moment to breathe and filter out the overwhelming fields of other people's anxieties and hopes. I was too exhausted for it.

Through the stair handrails, I noticed her immediately—a tall figure in pink, hunched on the steps. Something in her posture hinted a clear sign of profound sorrow. Someone else would walk past quietly, uncomfortable with raw emotion, but I couldn't. My steps slowed, softening to avoid startling her. As expected, she was crying, lost in a private moment of grief that seemed to fill the entire stairwell.

I hesitated. As a medical student, I was aware of the boundaries between compassion and professional distance. But compassion rarely follows rules. Carefully, I sat down a few steps away, leaving enough space to respect her solitude while offering a silent presence. She looked up, surprised—perhaps not expecting anyone to notice, let alone sit near her. My hand instinctively reached into my pocket, pulling out a pack of tissues. I offered them to her. She accepted them, and wiped her tears with a vulnerability that seemed to fill the space between us.

Something felt very strange. Beyond her visible sorrow, I could sense layers of emotion—guilt, anger and hesitation, a complex emotional landscape that went far deeper than simple grief. After years of clinical training, I knew the typical emotional terrains of patients and their families. This was different.

I reached out, offering a slow, tender hug—not with clinical detachment, but with a warmth that came from something more intimate than medical training. She accepted immediately, her head finding my shoulder with a heart-warming trust. Her broad back trembled slightly under my touch, and I felt the weight of her unspoken pain.

"Do you know me?" she asked finally, hinting a mixture of confusion and hope.

I paused. Did I know her? Not in a conventional sense. But I knew her raw emotions with an intimacy that was beyond explanation. Fragments of memory surfaced—a playground, a pink t-shirt, a childhood moment that felt so distant. It was like a chapter in a textbook I studied a long time ago.

"You're Sera, right?" The name came out with a certainty I couldn't explain.

Her surprised expression told me she was wondering how I knew. I was wearing a white coat—she likely assumed I'd recognized her from some medical file. But this connection was something else entirely.

"I'm not a doctor yet," I smiled, sensing her unasked questions. "Just a med student. I met you once, when I was a child."

In that moment, I wasn't just offering comfort. I was creating a bridge between two souls, intimately acquainted with the same despair.

"Do I know you?" she asked, trying to recollect her childhood despite the weight of her current emotions clouding her mind.

With a glance at the files on her lap, I noticed a name—Arthur Clair. I understood her father was a patient here.

"Ah, sorry. My name is Leila Lysandra—David's daughter," I explained, "You're Arthur's daughter, right?" Her nod was barely noticeable.

"I heard David adopted a daughter," she murmured, searching for a distant memory. "But I can't quite remember..."

"I saw you briefly, years ago," I continued softly. "When my dad brought me to Atlas City, maybe fifteen years back. I remember watching you in the playground. Arthur mentioned you then, his daughter Seraphine." A subtle recognition
flickered in her eyes, bridging the gap between then and now.

"I'm sorry about your dad," I said softly, "Please let me know if there's anything I can do for you."

"Thank you. You just did a lot already. Your hug took half my distress," she replied with a faint smile.

"Can I take a look at the files?" I asked, thinking it might be painful for her to explain her father's condition herself. She nodded and handed me the files. I opened them gently, my medical training immediately parsing the clinical narrative.

He had been suffering from Coronary Artery Disease for more than a decade—a progressive condition characterized by thickening coronary arteries. The clinical notes detailed years of increasing symptoms: chest pain, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. It seemed he was now in a terminal stage. Assuming Seraphine was a final year student like myself, I quickly calculated the grim probability: he might not survive to see her graduate. This would explain her profound sorrow. But what of the guilt and hesitation I sensed?

Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) remained the only surgical option—a complex procedure involving harvesting healthy blood vessels, typically from the internal mammary artery or saphenous vein, to reroute blood flow around the blocked coronary arteries. Yet, at this advanced stage, the surgical risks would be significant.

"Did you schedule a surgery?" I asked, without thinking much, hoping I could offer some help.

She shook her head. Immediately, I felt the sting of my own insensitivity. Of course, without health insurance, the surgery costs would be too much of a burden for a family of a retired professor.

"I hope the insurance claim gets approved soon," she muttered. I wished with all my heart it would be. It would almost explain her overwhelming emotions of guilt and hesitation.

"Let me know if I can help accelerate the process, Sera," I offered. She nodded. I wanted to propose financial support but stopped myself. This would be better handled by my dad—he was, after all, her father's friend.

"Sera, can I have your phone number?" I asked, pulling out my mobile. We exchanged phone numbers.

"I don't think my dad knows about his friend's condition," I muttered. If he did, he would have mentioned it.

"Sorry," she said softly. "These past months have been depressing. Dad's been unconscious most of the time. He never wanted to bother his friends, so I didn't contact anyone." I took her phone again, feeling the weight of her unspoken struggle.

"Is visiting allowed?" I asked, saving my dad's number. She nodded.

"I'll make sure my dad visits yours," I promised. "I'll always be here for you, Sera. So will my dad. Never hesitate to reach out. Many doctors here are my professors—I'd be honored to help in any way I can."

"Thank you, Leila," she said, her voice finding a moment of strength. "My dad would be happy to see Mr. David. I grew up hearing so much about him. Is he still teaching at Atlas University?"

"Yes," I replied, sensing an opportunity for therapeutic small talk. "Most of his colleagues are retired now. He's been quite lonely. My classes are now in Asclepius Hall near the hospital so I rarely see him these days. You know how it is—a final year student, buried in textbooks, barely getting out of my dorm."

"I'm also an Atlas University student," she shared. "Philosophy—following my dad's footsteps. I should've graduated a year ago, but I got injured playing basketball."

"Oh, no. Arthur would've..." I caught myself, the unfinished sentence hanging in the air. She nodded, a sad smile flickering across her face.

"The injury wasn't your fault," I comforted her, hoping to ease her invisible burden.

"I know. But I didn't have insurrance," she muttered, shrugging her shoulders.

"Healthcare industry is such an evil business. You're not responsible for how such a system that's supposed to heal us could be so parasitic. If anything, I'm just another cog in this machine," I explained.

She laughed—a brief moment of relief that couldn't quite dispel the storm of emotions swirling around her. Beneath her surface, I still sensed an unescapable gravity of distress. What hidden waves of guilt and hesitation were pulling her down?

"Sera," I said softly, "I don't want to invade your privacy. But I've been through enough patient rounds to see something deeper is troubling you. This is more than your dad's condition. More than a delayed graduation." I paused, offering her an open invitation. "If you need anything—anything at all—I'm here."

"Thank you. You've helped more than I could ask," she replied, attempting a smile. I knew my words weren't enough to unlock her hidden pain.

"Whatever it is," I continued, "I have faith in the path you'll choose. I know my words can't fix anything. But I believe in you. I believe in your choice. You're already carrying so much. Don't punish yourself for things beyond your control. Regrets will find us no matter what we do. That doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Do what you need to do, and I'll always be here for you."

She wrapped me in a desperate hug, her big arms holding on like I was her last anchor. "Thank you," she whispered again and again. I felt like her sister in that moment—and I knew she wasn't the only one destined to share such an intimate bond with me.

## Chapter XI - Neck of Hydra [Politics] (raw)

The thing about pulling a thread is that it seems like it would never end. It took me four years to identify the organization behind my parents' death. The thread ended with a private intelligence firm called Aegis Advisory.

Of course, my parents weren't the only victims. I sorted through public news for cases that were similar—suspicious accidents, missing persons, silenced journalists. I lived in the obituaries, cross-referencing the names involved: the lawyers, the forensic specialists, the responding officers. Most trails led nowhere. But a handful shared the same names, the same patterns. A few key individuals kept appearing, and their presence was the trail.

Didn't I have a well-trained talent for seeing patterns? But my investigation would have been stuck in many places if not for Art. She always had a magical sense that made jumps I could never make sense of. Where my logic hit a wall, She'd point at two seemingly unrelated names—a lawyer in Berlin and an engineer in Lisbon. Sometimes wouldn't you just have to make a wild guess in a really difficult sudoku puzzle? She has a gift of making the correct guess. It was she who saw that all those scattered individuals were connected, that everything was leading back to a single parent organization: Aegis Advisory.

They were a mercenary firm, a black box. Aegis didn't employ assassins; they employed systems. It was made up of diverse cells of operatives in many countries—engineers to orchestrate the failure, lawyers to seal the record, forensic experts to bless the lie. The very dots that led me to them were part of their design. I had uncovered the weapon, but not the hand that held it. The thread, which had finally found a name, now felt endless once more, leading into a deeper, darker labyrinth.

Art and I worked with "Kaspar's Traveling Illusions" for six years. While I learned the art of manipulation with a focus on strategist planning, Art did the same with a focus on sensational perception. The magic tour was a replacement for traditional education—I learned as many secrets behind the tricks as possible while Art learned how to play all the musical instruments we had. We earned enough for college that we never enrolled for. Even though we quit the travelling crew, we never stopped travelling. Art created a new identity for me—my name was Pallas Palamedes just like hers was Acanthia Andriades.

We never stayed in a city more than a month. We learned way too early that my paranoia wasn't even overreaction. When the crew arrived in Vienna again, I visited St. Matthew to see Sister Cecilia and she told me shady people came to ask about me. She kept them distracted from the truth. It was the last time I saw her—she asked me to never visit her again for my own safety. 

I could imagine my parents were the reason why they would keep tabs on me the same way I kept tabs on them but to our surprise, Art was also tracked. An Altarian spy who was posing as a joggler even joined the magic crew for a few months to look for Aria Selas. If only we let our guard down for a second. He acted like he was a friend of the Athenian couple who was genuinely worried about their missing daughter. Art somehow knew he never met her parents. She came up with a story that her Yia-yia might know about them—Kaspar supported her narrative. He would've recognized her if not for the make-up she wore everyday—or he pretended he didn't so well and even Art with her extraordinary perception could never know. We suspected even Tingxuan might have been a Chinese spy.

We knew things were more complicated than they appeared. Faced with the Altarian man, Art wanted to go home but we learned her parents vanished without a trace two year after she left them. She was as homeless as me. We concluded it must be related to why many adults were looking for her. We were all we had. While they were tracking us down, I was also profiling them.

The web of informations I collected no longer fit in the wooden box which I left with the crew. We carried luggages now. The data I've been collecting had been fully digitalized—all stored inside a portable drive. I burned all the paper pieces no matter how sentimental they were; weren't they future criminal evidence anyway? I still got the Bible and the chess set while Art still had her Hesiod.

We arrived in Frankfurt a week ago. It would be a long story to explain why we were there. We would need to talk about a man that was already in prison first. His name was Theo Finch. He was a financier who handled the financial assets of almost all the most powerful people in the world. It wasn't even difficult to profile him; his life story was already in the news. What was interesting was that he was the primary client of Aegis Advisory. Of course, he would never contact the firm himself. It took me a decade of black hat work to identify the lawyers who placed the final call. Again, it was Art who connected the dots and saw that all these lawyers worked for Theo Finch.

He was the node that had maximun number of connections to the other nodes in my web. He had a hand in many atrocities in recent decades. Organized crime activites? Checked. Political assassinations? Checked? Union busting? Checked. Environmental and industrial sabotage? Checked. Human trafficking? Checked—it was how he got caught. Arms Trafficking? Checked. Resource coup financing? Checked. Economic destabilization? Checked. Even the secret services in related countries probably didn't have a compendium of his best hits as complete as I did—or they were in bed with him.

If I wanted to live free, I would have to take them all down. Not just Theo Finch. Him and all of his clients. It was like Hydra—cut one head, two will replace it. Art taught me Greek and I had a privilege of reading Hesiod in Greek. She was right—Hesiod understood human nature better. Heracles, commonly known as Hercules, defeated Hydra with the help of Iolaus who cauterized the neck of Hydra so it wouldn't replace the cut heads. We were in Frankfurt for the very same reason.

Theo Finch had a system. He had a set of key phrases, each for one of his clients. I concluded he must have memorized the keys. Each key phrase was the only thing that gave him access to the encrypted system of each client. It was precisely how the most powerful people in the world managed their financial assets. A complete trust in a financier. Of course, they tried to get him out of prison and they succeeded. But Theo Finch was arrested again in four years when new evidences emerged. I didn't think he was being sloppy. Overconfidence was his demise. He thought all the law enforcement officers worldwide were under his control. Of course, some were too naive to be in his network.

Art named his network the Squires of the Horsemen. It was a reference to the Four Horsemen of Apoclypse. These people were exactly like the bullies in St. Matthew but in a exponentially larger scale. They were responsible for atrocities world wide. That Theo Finch got arrested was a lucky accident. One head of Hydra was cut without a swing of sword by us. We need to make sure that no more head replace it. Or at least we needed to make sure a head that we could control would replace him. It was precisely why we were in Frankfurt.

Intelligence we gathered confirmed there would be a party at the MesseTurm penthouse. Prior to our arrival in Frankfurt, we already identified the string quartet scheduled to perform. It wasn't that complicated to phish the concertmaster. It took me two days to select the target; a violinist who Art would replace in the event. Of course, Art made the final decision on who the target would be and how to manipulate her. I created a fake medical emergency of her family member and replaced her with Alba Rosa, Art's musician alias. While I was working on digital espionage, Art worked on embedding microphones into the set of musical instruments identical to the quartet's, ensuring a seamless swap.
