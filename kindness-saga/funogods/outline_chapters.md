## I. prologue

Four children were born in the same year in different parts of the world; Soren Socrates in Copenhagen, Denmark, Astrid Apollonia in Athens, Greece, Leila Lysandra in Shiraz, Iran, Pallas Palamedes in Vienna, Austria. Each child has different backgrounds but they all share one thing; their passion to seek truth.

Soren excels in geometry, algebra and science in general. His mom is a nuclear physicist who gave birth to him with the help of a sperm donor using IVF. Once he gets his hands on Euclid's Elements, he rediscovers everything up to Renaissance Era's science on his own at the age of 8. After losing his mom to cancer, he realizes the world is a cruel place for him. He has to deal with Autism Spectrum Disorder, Social Anxiety while surviving in the world that torment him.

Astrid can hear colors and see melody. She finds herself to be a fan girl of Homer. She can get used to any instrument in no time. She always runs away from her classes because they're too strict and unimaginative. Her therapist diagnoses her with Schizotypal Personality Disorder. But she believes her senses are real and the doctor is just less imaginative. One day, she runs away from her home to follow a luminous thread only she can see. It leads her to Atlas City.

Leila is very perceptive. Reflection is her strength. She's obsessed with Sappho's poems. She understands we'll never be able to see ourselves without love. Her mother is a psychoanalyst secretly working as a consultant in an Iranian anarchist community. She learns about the cruelty of the world when her mom was assassinated. She comes to Atlas City with her psychologist father.

Pallas is a child of political scientists that died in an accident. He suspects his parents' accident wasn't an accident. He grows up in an orphanage. He's an expert of desire. He get bullied constantly because he looks neither male nor female. But he doesn't become spiteful. He never stop being pacifist. He idolizes Diogenes. He convince his bullies to do what they truly desire to do instead of bullying him.

## II. reason (Soren's POV)

Soren joins Atlas University. He could have applied for any scholarship but he doesn't want him name in records. Atlas City seems like a perfect place where he can follow his academic passion and live without distractions. He meets a professor that preaches anarchist ideas. He couldn't help pointing out where the professor fails to be rigour and a girl obsessed with pink defends the professor. Despite his social anxiety, he finds her warm. He befriends her eventually. Her name is Seraphine.

---

## III. heart (Leila's POV)

After graduating, Leila joins Atlas Medical School. As a medical student, she has to often go to Atlas General. She meets a girl crying on the stairs at the hospital once. She hugs her without saying anything. Somehow she knows she's her father's friend's daughter, Seraphine. She feels like she's one of her siblings even though she's the only child. She never know why she's always felt like she has 3 siblings. Now she thinks Seraphine is also a sister.

## IV. dream (Astrid's POV)

Astrid finds the end of the thread she's been following at "Guillotine" Bar. Thanks to her mesmerizing voice, it was easy for her to become a singer. She's singing Cigarettes After Sex's Apocalypse when she sees a girl obsessed with pink and a man. She sees them going into the same toilet. She sees them coming out but somehow she knows they kissed in the restroom. She doesn't understand why but she sees the same thread she's been following is connected to both of them.

---

## V. desire (Pallas' POV)

It was never difficult for Pallas to become a hacker. He can see anyone's desire in their eyes, in their voice, in their words. Social engineering is something he can do at ease. He has been looking for comrades but he never find one adequate enough. Atlas University Convocation Hall is blown up. He joins the University amid chaos, as there's no way to verify student records, after losing physical and digital records to bombing.

## VI. comrade (Astrid's POV)

Astrid is drinking "free-will" at "Guillotine" bar. She sees the thread again and it's now connected to Pallas. Pallas smiles at her and tells her he needs a fake ID. Astrid doesn't understand why he's telling her so. "Are you talking to me?" "What do you think you desire?" "Kindness," Astrid gently answers. "Through which means?" "Through art, I think." He smiles again and tells her "What is forging an ID if not a necessary form of art? Is art not restructuring the world we live in?" Astrid nods.

## VII. dream of eden (Soren's POV)

Soren is at "Guillotine" Bar with Seraphine. Once Astrid starts singing, he somehow knows she's connected to him. Seraphine confesses she wants to start an orphanage because she realizes such institutes are merely money laundering operations. Soren wants to support her. Astrid finishes singing and goes straight to Soren's table. "Can I sit here?" Seeing no reason to say no, Soren nods, although he doesn't understand if it's ok for her to be present  here. Astrid looks at Seraphine and says, "God banished us from Eden. We can't reenter it without defying God." Soren understands what she's saying but Seraphine is confused. Astrid clarifies, "Metaphors aside, a friend told me it's you that robbed Sun Diagnostics. You can't use that funds to start an orphanage that defy the status quo. You need to make up paperwork to stay invisible. Let me help you."

Pallas tells them he need the help from Soren and Astrid for a crusade. He needs to break into NexBank to steal a financier's records. [it's a conspiracy files that mirrors Epstein's files.] He thinks it's the key to controlling the most powerful people's dark background. Astrid asks how it has anything to do with Seraphine. Pallas smiles and tells them she has experience. He explains "by warmth you mean the flame in Atlas University and you know this is a chance for your revenge."
