## I. prologue

Four children were born in the same year in different parts of the world; Soren Socrates in Copenhagen, Denmark, Astrid Philomela in Athens, Greece, Leila Lysandra in Shiraz, Iran, Pallas Rosaline in Vienna, Austria. Each child has different backgrounds but they all share one thing; their passion to seek truth.

Soren excels in geometry, algebra and science in general. His mom is a nuclear physicist who gave birth to him with the help of a sperm donor using IVF. Once he gets his hands on Euclid's Elements, he rediscovers everything up to Renaissance Era's science on his own at the age of 8. After losing his mom to cancer, He leaves his home town to seek his destiny.

Astrid can hear colors and see melody. She finds herself to be a fan girl of Homer. She can get used to any instrument in no time. She always runs away from her classes because they're too strict and unimaginative. One day, she runs away from her home to follow a luminous thread only she can see.

Leila is very perceptive. Reflection is her strength. She can fall in love with anyone. She's obsessed with Sappho's poems. She understands we'll never be able to see ourselves without love. She comes to Atlas City with her psychologist father when her mother psychoanalyst was assassinated because she was a consultant in an Iranian anarchist community.

Pallas is an expert of desire. He grows up being bullied because he looks neither male nor female. But he doesn't become spiteful. He never stop being pacifist. He idolizes Diogenes. He convince his bullies to do what they truly desire to do instead of bullying him.

---

## II. reason (Soren's POV)

Soren joins Atlas University. He could have applied for any scholarship but he doesn't want him name in records. Atlas City seems like a perfect place where he can follow his academic passion and live without distractions. He meets a professor that preaches anarchist ideas. He couldn't help pointing out where the professor fails to be rigour and a girl obsessed with pink defends the professor. He befriends her eventually. Her name is Seraphine.

---

## III. heart (Leila's POV)

After graduating, Leila joins Atlas Medical School. As a medical student, she has to often go to Atlas General. She meets a girl crying on the stairs at the hospital once. She hugs her without saying anything. Somehow she knows she's her father's friend's daughter, Seraphine. She feels like she's one of her siblings even though she's the only child. She never know why she's always felt like she has 3 siblings. Now she thinks Seraphine is also a sister.

---

## IV. dream (Astrid's POV)

Astrid finds the end of the thread she's been following at "Guillotine" Bar. Thanks to her mesmerizing voice, it was easy for her to become a singer. She's singing Cigarettes After Sex's Apocalypse when she sees a girl obsessed with pink and a man. She sees them going into the same toilet. She sees them coming out but somehow she knows they kissed in the restroom. She doesn't understand why but she sees the same thread she's been following is connected to both of them.

---

## V. desire (Pallas' POV)

It was never difficult for Pallas to become a hacker. He can see anyone's desire in their eyes, in their voice, in their words. Social engineering is something he can do at ease. He has been looking for comrades but he never find one adequate enough. Atlas University Convocation Hall is blown up. He joins the University amid chaos, as there's no way to verify student records, after losing physical and digital records to bombing.

---

## VI. comrade (Astrid's POV)

Astrid is drinking "free-will" at "Guillotine" bar. She sees the thread again and it's now connected to Pallas. Pallas smiles at her and tells her he needs a fake ID. Astrid doesn't understand why he's telling her so. "Are you talking to me?" "What do you think you desire?" "Kindness," Astrid gently answers. "Through which means?" "Through art, I think." He smiles again and tells her "What is forging an ID if not a necessary form of art? Is art not restructuring the world we live in?" Astrid nods.

---

## VII. dream of eden (Soren's POV)

Soren is at "Guillotine" Bar with Seraphine. Once Astrid starts singing, he somehow knows she's connected to him. Seraphine confesses she wants to start an orphanage because she realizes such institutes are merely money laundering operations. Soren wants to support her. Astrid finishes singing and goes straight to Soren's table. "Can I sit here?" Seeing no reason to say no, Soren nods, although he doesn't understand if it's ok for her to be present  here. Astrid looks at Seraphine and says, "God banished us from Eden. We can't reenter it without defying God." Soren understands what she's saying but Seraphine is confused. Astrid clarifies, "Metaphors aside, a friend told me it's you that robbed Sun Diagnostics. You can't use that funds to start an orphanage that defy the status quo. You need to make up paperwork to stay invisible. Let me help you."

---

## VIII. heist for eden (Pallas's POV)

Astrid brings Soren and Seraphine to Oblivion Museum to meet Pallas. Pallas asks each what they thinks they desire. Astrid answers "warmth". Soren answers "consistency". Astrid answers "turning dream into real". Pallas tells Seraphine her funds aren't enough for the orphanage. Astrid corrects, "it's called Strawberries Home". Pallas tells them he need the help from Soren and Astrid for some missions he assigned himself. He needs to break into NexBank to steal a financier's records. [it's a conspiracy files that mirrors Epstein's files.] He thinks it's the key to controlling the most powerful people's dark background. Astrid asks how it has anything to do with Seraphine. Pallas smiles and tells them she has experience. He explains "by warmth you mean the flame in Atlas University and you know this is a chance for your revenge." Seraphine is surprised again to see that Pallas not only knows she has a crush on the arsonist, but she hates the former girlfriend of his, that's working at NexBank. She agrees to join the heist.

## IX.

## I. THE PROFESSOR’S FALL

Science points out to help the Professor understand his fight against oppression: Conquest wears three faces—Quantification, Dishonesty, Subjugation. Seraphine, the pink-obsessed girl from his lectures, doesn’t understand—but she defends him anyway.

Then Love’s arrives. Pregnant with Revolution's child, she corners Seraphine in the library:

"Raise my child."

"Why me?"

"You’ll see."

Seraphine submits her resignation letter approved by the Professor—just before he bombs the convocation hall, destroying student records and exam papers. "Let them see the system in flames," he says.

The state brands him a terrorist. The Director of Feds (Bureaucracy, Famine’s squire) ensures his life sentence. The Editor-in-Chief of State Media (Silence, Death’s squire) broadcasts his fall.

## II. THE HEISTS FOR EDEN

At the Guillotine bar, Seraphine confesses her dream to Science: an orphanage named Strawberries Home. "If only I had funding," she sighs. Science smirks: "Don’t worry about it." Poetry, the singer, slides beside them after singing "Bella Ciao" and unfolds a plan: four heists to fund Eden.

Seraphine hesitates. What if the crimes trace back to the orphans? But Science proves Poetry’s plans flawless. With the knights’ help, Seraphine becomes Red Tiger:

Science infiltrates a vault of NexBank. (target: Debt, Famine’s squire).

Revolution raids the Moir.ai HR Manager mansion. (Subjugation, Conquest’s squire).

Love strikes the PM’s residence (Propaganda, War’s squire) and the General’s compound (Submission, War’s squire).

Eden is stolen back from God. Seraphine takes a new name, Strawberry.

## III. THE WAR

For years, the knights wage their shadow war on two fronts:

Love infiltrates the secret service as a consultant, while Poetry plays violin at elite balls—gathering intelligence to prevent Nuclear World War.

Science and Revolution hide themselves within Moir.ai, posing as researchers to investigate the data fueling the war machine.

During a mission, Revolution uncovers a plot: the coercion of foreign federal agents (K’s parents) through the kidnapping of their child. He intervenes, spiriting K away to Strawberries Home, where his own son, P, lives.

The knights’ rendezvous point is Oblivion Museum, its curator (Oblivion, Death’s squire) meticulously erasing genocides from exhibits. Poetry notices the pattern—history rewritten in real time—and they realize the curator serves the Horsemen. Yet, because Moir.ai’s executives remain oblivious to the knights’ discussions, they assume the curator is merely a silent witness.

## IV. THE POINT OF NO RETURN

While distracted by preventing the World War, Revolution and Science make a horrifying discovery:

Moir.ai’s predictions now hit 97% accuracy for individual fates because not only it predicts human desire but also manipulate to imprison free will.

The system is one update away from erasing free will entirely.

Poetry and Love respond by organizing clandestine protests, but the squires retaliate ruthlessly:

The Director of Feds (Bureaucracy, Famine's squire) deploys riot units.

The Prime Minister (Propaganda, War's squire) spins the narrative.

The Editor-in-Chief (Silence, Death's squire) censors dissent.

The celebrity (Dishonesty, Conquest's squire) distract the people and General (Submission, War's squire) violently break up the movement.

When Moir.ai exposes Revolution and Science’s true intentions, they’re terminated on the spot by the HR Manager (Subjugation, Conquest’s squire). With no options left, they turn to Strawberry—now a ghost in the system, the only one untraceable enough to strike back.

## V. THE FINAL GAMBIT

Four knights design a near-flawless plan: infiltrate Moir.ai’s data center inside 600-year old bank facility's vault owned by NexBank—the sole access point to its infrastructure, which security system resembles what Red Tiger's first heist years prior.

Love, posing as a psychiatrist, extracts intel from the NexBank president's assistant.

Poetry, performing at the ball of the Feds, maps violent crime division's protocols.

With hesitation, Science and Poetry ask Strawberry to execute the impossible.

Science recognizes the professor's Tao Te Ching at Strawberries Home.

## IV. THE FINAL HEIST

Strawberry executes the NexBank heist, making it looks like a crypto heist from the cold wallet. But her true mission is deeper:

She plants a backdoor in Moir.ai’s servers.

Erases all digital traces (logs, security footage).

Leaves no physical evidence.

The Director of Feds (Bureaucracy, Famine's squire) alerts Telos Corporation, the parent company of Moir.ai and Nex Group, whose CEO is (Cowardice, War's squire) — despite finding no proof of intrusion. The paranoid CTO of Moir.ai (Quantification, Conquest’s squire) suspects the truth. For three days, he scours systems until he finds a phantom network blip—just enough to declare war.

Global manhunt begins.

An emergency stand-down stops Moir.ai's maintenance entirely.

All sysadmins locked out; users suffer glitches.

Monitoring teams find nothing, because Revolution and Science lie low, warned by hacked federal emails (courtesy of Love/Poetry’s social engineering).

After ten days of forced inactivity, the system stabilizes and the hacked emails reveal the stand-down order has been lifted. Revolution and Science make their move accessing the network through Strawberry's backdoor, its signature deliberately mismatched from the whitelisted MAC addresses and IP ranges of Moir.ai's new secret sysadmins.

The CTO's trap springs shut the moment they connect.

What follows is a brutal, microscopic war fought in the network:

The CTO's security protocols attempt to immediately lock them out

Their counterattack leverages the script-generated credentials and penetration toolkit prepared during the stand-down

They hijack authenticated user sessions as pivot points

The knights deploy a cascade of decryption keys like sonic mines

The CTO watches in real-time as they exfiltrate Moir.ai's core model. When he realizes they're seconds from capturing the proprietary prediction algorithms, he makes the call that will haunt him contacting the Director of Feds to escalate from digital to physical containment.

The tactical raid achieves its objective at terrible cost. K and C die in the crossfire, their blood soaking the floor of Strawberries Home as the remaining children are evacuated to underground bunkers. Yet even as the knights mourn, their war continues now fought from shadows within shadows.

## V. THE LAST STAND

Poetry and Love reverse-engineer Moir.ai, rewriting its destiny-collecting data from churches and support groups. Science and Revolution, aided by blackhat networks and opensource communities worldwide, codify the tweaks.

The knights’ final mission: infiltrate the paranoid CTO’s fortress—the only place with source-code access. They know escape is impossible.

Inside, they:

Upload the new code.

Updating the new patch, they have a conversation with the Moir.ai during the confirmation step.

"The perfect world is so close. The world without crimes. The world without suffering. Are you sure you want to push this chaotic patch, at the cost of suffering?"

"Let there be suffering."

Erase all traces.

Hide within the fortress as the CTO and global law enforcement hunt them in vain.

Their last act is self-erasure. (They kill themselves and execute a self-destroy mechanism to destroy their own bodies because they're ordinary humans.)

## VI. AFTERMATH

Moir.ai’s predictions plummet to 47% accuracy.

Users rejoice at the "improved" AI.

Stocks surge 470%.

The CEO/CTO seethe, blind to the hack. The CTO can't revert the patch because they can't risk losing users. It's impossible to reverse-engineer the new patch because the chaotic humanity is embedded in it.

The billionaire CEO (Cowardice, War’s squire) pivots to deep-sea lithium mining—another kind of theft.

In a bunker, P clutches Tao Te Ching from alexandria.

On the table is a letter from his parents:

"Forgive us. We must steal free will back from the false gods. We fought so you don't have to."
