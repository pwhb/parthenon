## chapter i (Science)

"Oh my sweet Science, did you just derive Hamilton's Principle," mom said, looking at the whiteboard.

"I'll never understand how such a beautiful mind was conceived inside me. When I was 10, I was dressing up paper dolls. I'll never be as brilliant as you, my dear." I could sense an overwhelming intensity of joy and pride in her voice. She wasn't just looking at a whiteboard filled with mathematical equations. She was looking at my weeks of exhausting work on these mechanics problems. My investigation of the physical world in the language I'm most fluent with.

I felt relieved. I got somewhere finally without getting entangled in specificalities. I wasn't pursuing physics like mom; she was a nuclear physicist working at the University of Copenhagen. I was more drawn to the pure beauty of mathematical abstraction. Physics was her passion; Mathematics was mine. While she saw the beauty in theoretical predictions and experimental verifications, I was captivated by the elegant magic of describing the universe through pure abstraction. But aren't we approaching the same truth from different sides? Isn't it the beauty of Science, anyway?

"Will you have your dinner now, my baby Science? I made your favourite dish." I could never fully express how much I loved mom. She knew I wouldn't have dinner without getting somewhere. I almost forgot how hungry I was.

Mom called me Science. It was what she loved most in the entire universe. I believed she never hesitated to name me Science; it must have been as if she never considered another word that could describe her love for me. I never knew who my dad was. Neither did my mom. One day, she realized she wanted to give birth to me and contacted her friend at the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. She had always known physical intimacy wasn't her way of connecting with others. Throughout her life, she'd had occasional relationships, but maintaining them without getting physical proved challenging. In the end, she chose a path of motherhood that was entirely her own. She ticked 'anonymous donor' in the form, despite her curious mind of a scientist. A mysterious donor giving me the other half of genes seemed more profound than someone she could contact. Who my father was never mattered to me or my mom. There were more than enough problems we could enjoy solving.

I had to bring a textbook to the dinner table. I couldn't wait to compare my derivation with the textbooks. Mom mentioned the exact chapter I needed to look up. I could swear these mathematical symbols danced with an ethereal luminescence before my eyes. I realized I had traced the same beautiful mathematical path others had walked before me. The joy wasn't in being first, but in understanding the universal language that explains the universe.

I remembered how happy mom was when I was more curious about how the ball moved when you threw it rather than playing with it. "Mom, does that boy know how to catch the ball because he can predict its route from the initial configuration?" I remember she laughed. She gave me Euclid's Elements for my 7th birthday. It was still my favorite book of all time. She taught me physics before I knew who I was. But there was always this skepticism that made me hesitant to intuitively accept physical laws for granted. Why was light refracted this way instead of all the other possible paths? I realized now I understood these phenomena in the most abstract sense human science can explain.

I spent a few more weeks deriving all the other physics principles I knew from one universal principle I just rediscovered; that of stationary action. One day, I decided to send an email to Luna on mom's computer. Before I talked about Luna, I needed to talk about mom's secret work, or at least what I call her secret work. I always hated when mom had to travel to work with her physicist colleagues from Santandería. She often brought me to university conferences, but these foreign colleagues remained a mysterious presence, always kept at a distance from my little world. I never nagged her to take me with her though.

"I'll only be away for four days, my baby Science. Luna will be here to look after you."

She always asked Luna to babysit me. Luna was her graduate student. She was always very kind to me. Unlike other people, she never treated me like I was weird. It never looked like babysitting with her. It was more like a private lecture; except that neither of us would know who was supposed to be the lecturer. I used to ask her a lot of questions that I would've asked mom if she was with me. I thought she might've found them frustrating but she found them fun. It was how Luna realized she could offload her assignments to my little brain. Sometimes my skepticism could help her see something she missed because she took it for granted. She always appreciated my strong sense of rigour in everything.

"For the last time, my sweet Science, Luna is my graduate student. Not yours. Please don't help her with her homework," mom said laughingly. I nodded. I knew it was Luna when I heard the door knock. I ran to help her carry the bags to my mom's room where Luna would stay at. She brought two bags of textbooks.

"Luna, I'll fail your entire assignment if my son solves it for you — and I'll enjoy doing it," mom warned her with a straight face. Luna smiled sheepishly.

"It's ok, mom. These books are for me. I'd like to start studying other sciences for a change," I defended Luna. Luna gestured towards a bag with a subtle nod of her chin, and I unzipped it to reveal the contents to mom. 'The Origin of Species' and a collection of biology texts Luna had borrowed from the university library sat inside. Mom's hand found its way to my head, rubbing it with a mixture of affection and pride. She turned to Luna, expressing her gratitude with a warmth that transcended words.

When her colleagues' car pulled up outside, she bid us both farewell. Luna and I walked her to the car, helping her load her luggage for the trip.

"Have a safe trip, Professor Alma. I'll make sure Science won't do my assignments," said Luna with an attempt to light up the dim moment.

Mom laughed, holding Luna's hand. "Take care of my little scientist," she said, then turned to ruffle my hair. We watched the car move away from us until it was out of our view.

Luna and I went back to my mom's room. I couldn't wait to open Darwin's book. Luna settled into mom's desk chair, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. "Hey little buddy, what changed your mind suddenly? You always demanded more rigorous equations in my homework than even Professor Alma did. Do you feel like you finished everything you wanted to do with physics?"

I shook my head. "I'm afraid I won't be able to finish working with the secrets of the universe anytime soon. But isn't the fun more about exploring the secrets rather than actually finding them? I feel uncomfortable when I don't find something rigorous. I'm sorry if I've sounded like I'm too demanding. I just don't know how to be comfortable without understanding something rigorously. Thank you for always being patient with me."

"You're welcome, little buddy. I hope you find a fantastic journey with biology. Just let me know whenever you want me to look for more books. Ah, I almost forgot, my friend from the Department of Biology said she's willing to help with anything you find confusing."

I nodded. I grabbed Darwin's book in my arms and went to my bedroom to start reading it.

## chapter ii (Art)

I hated shrinks. They acted like they could fix people like a mechanic fixed an engine. I was not an engine. I was just a creative little brat. The beauty of an engine lies in its mechanical nature while mine lies in organic nature that other organic creatures like my parents failed to grasp. It started with me siding with the girl who was bullied at school. I could tell they had been bullying her for a long time.

"Astrid, did you really see them hurting her?" the teacher asked. I was stunned by their question. How could they possibly doubt the victim? I've always been perceptive, but how blind did they have to be to suspect the victim might be lying? Couldn't they see the obvious scars?

"Please don't tell me I'm the only one who can see the scars," I responded.

The girl looked at me apologetically. She had convinced the teachers it was just an accident. I didn't blame her. It made perfect sense to not expect justice from such teachers. It was clever of her to avoid making her bullies hate her more than they already did.

I would never forget their mocking eyes. The shameless teachers not only failed to recognize their moral bankruptcy but also told my parents I was fabricating stories.

"Astrid, I understand you must have your reasons for reporting to the teachers," said my mom's good friend, Mr. David Lysandra.

He was a professor from Atlas University, visiting Athens for a conference. My parents invited him to our home. They said he wanted to get to know me since he heard about me from my mom. But I could see he was a shrink and they asked for his diagnosis. They really thought I was making things up. I didn't know why but I agreed to talk to him. I had no intention of proving I was sane. I just saw a faint luminous thread connected to him that apparently nobody else could see.

"How long have you known the girl who was hurt?" Mr. David asked gently.

I genuinely had no idea how to explain to them. I didn't know the girl or the bullies. They weren't even from my class. I saw her scars and I saw their cruel punchable faces.

"I met her the first time yesterday," I replied honestly.

"Was she already hurt when you met her?" he asked. At least he was more patient than the teachers that dismissed me. I nodded.

"Did she tell you how she got hurt?" he asked, almost sounding like he genuinely cared. I shook my head. She didn't need to speak; her scars told the entire story.

"How did you feel when you saw her hurt?" he asked calmly. I hated his measured tone. I wasn't the one who had been bullied—she was. Why wasn't he treating her instead? Or better yet, why wasn't he treating the bullies?

"Spicy," I answered. Stupid answer for stupid question.

"Elena often told me about your special talent. Have you ever heard of something called synesthesia?"

He seemed determined to get under my skin. Yes, I could hear colors and see songs. Did colorblind people treat others differently just because they perceived colors differently? Basic senses, like touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste, were all just about perceiving waves, and my senses were simply strong enough to perceive them in ways most people couldn't. I didn't see how this had anything to do with my sense of justice.

"Is it when I can smell skepticism in your voice?" I responded, attempting to look respectful. He smiled.

"You have a beautiful mind that perceives the world differently from most people. I think your parents were unnecessarily worried," he said, slowly beginning to make sense.

"Why did you feel like you wanted to tell the teachers about the little girl?"

Again, he was circling back to the start. I hated being interrogated. I hated being diagnosed. If I weren't intrigued by his luminous thread, I wouldn't even be tolerating this talk.

"It was my mistake. I saw no sense of justice in the teachers' eyes. But I reported what I saw anyway, in case I was mistaken. Unfortunately, I wasn't," I explained respectfully.

His eyes brightened with curiosity.

"Were you saying you felt like you already knew the end result?" It was a good question. If only his voice didn't smell of skepticism. I nodded.

"How do you feel knowing you weren't wrong?" He seemed endless in his questioning.

"Salty. I couldn't help trying to help her. It was my fault I got the authorities involved." I noticed his interest in my choice of words.

"So you felt like the authorities failed you?" Another good question. If only I couldn't sense the skepticism in his voice.

"I wouldn't care if they failed me. They failed her. They harassed a victim. They tried to spin a narrative that I was complicating their job."

"Astrid, I understand how you feel. I know you still sense skepticism in my voice. It's because I'm trying to understand you objectively."

If I were to be honest, I finally found this shrink interesting. I realized where he was mistaken. He should have been trying to understand me subjectively. He should have forgotten child psychology. He should have forgotten his diagnostic tools.

"I believe you're a kind kid. You understand your emotions well. You have good intentions. But the justice system is a little more complicated."

If only 'complicated' were a synonym for 'flawed', I whispered.

"It's not just your school. This situation is quite common. I'd understand the context better if I could talk to the girl and the other children you said were hurting her."

Exactly. He wasn't looking for the missing ring in the wrong place. How nice it would be if I couldn't see through his intention. He wasn't searching for the missing ring at all in the first place; he was simply examining the wrong place for the wrong reason. I found his approach amusing. I needed to give something witty to someone so completely missing the point.

"What's the difference between a therapist and a lawyer?" I asked him.

"A suit?" he answered, after thinking for a while.

He was funny. I could've been friends with him if he weren't a therapist trying to diagnose me.

"Exactly. Both of them listen to you and then convince you of a truth you can tolerate."

"What do you think is the version of the truth you can live with?" he asked instantly.

"I don't settle for a palatable truth. I expose the failures of authority. One layer at a time," I explained.

I was certain he was impressed. He admitted to admiring my resilience. He went on to reassure my parents about what happened at school. My perception of reality was so intense that it might have been impossible to investigate through conventional facts. I didn't even tell him I saw a luminous thread connected to him. In fact, I told nobody about it. Seeing that nobody seemed to notice it, I knew it was something I should've kept to myself. I never learned the exact details of his conversation with my parents, but somehow they misinterpreted his words, ultimately concluding I was struggling with Schizotypal Personality Disorder.
