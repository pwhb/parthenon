Act 1: Knights And Prophets
there have always been four truths. there have always been four horsemen of apocalypse. their names are science, art, love and revolution. we've witnessed their prophets among us. euler was a prophet of science. van gogh was a prophet of art. kierkegaard was a prophet of love. diogenes was a prophet of revolution. four knights were born in our times. each represents a truth.

Act 2: Science
Science is the sharp student judging the professor. he and the girl obsessed with strawberry pink met with a painter named Art. Science said the professor knew he was Science. Art can recreate the bar in a second. There's nothing Art can't create or reverse engineer. Science has a special ability to make things as clear as he can. bureaucracy is the squires of the horseman Famine.

Act 3: Revolution
Revolution was pregnant with Love's child. She meets Science and Strawberry in the campus. She asks Strawberry to raise her child. Strawberry, tired of the urban life, accepted. She said she doesn't have enough fund to raise the child. Science said Art can help. Revolution has a special ability to making people accept their fate. Revolution was the serpent in Eden. Strawberry knew she's destined to rebuild Eden. tech, marketing and management are the unholy trinity of business. the squires of conquest, the horseman.

Act 4: Art
Art shared Strawberry the blueprints of 4 buildings. She helped her do the first heist. She helped her build Strawberries Home. She robbed Eden back from God. Death was looking at Strawberries Home.

Act 5: Love
There were gang wars in the city. The mafia kidnapped a child of two federal agents that caught their godfather to blackmail. Love has infilitared the organization and saved the child. Without their godfather, the war to take his place happen.

Act 6: Apollo
Art admits she can't reverse engineer Apollo, the most powerful AI in the world that everyone uses. Apollo can predict anyone's mind and it's so close for everyone to lose free-will. Revolution and Love told Art, there's a way to get access to Apollo. Art and Science visits Strawberries Home again and Science recognized the Tao Te Ching on a desk. Art shared the heist plan to Strawberry, Strawberry does a final heist to break into the national bank and use the access key drive in the vault to run a script on the Apollo's network. Because any connection from new mac address or new ip address will alert the system.

Act 7: Government
The government is suspicious that the Apollo might be compromised due to the heist. They closely look for a sign that it was accessed. they found no logs in the network. they found no records in the vault's security system. But they found an unusual network traffic to Apollo network from the server in the vault. They started stand-down in Apollo network. All sysadmins were ordered not to access the network. They interrogate any sysadmin that access the network during the stand-down and make sure no word of this is leaked.

Act 8: Hack
The government is waiting for someone to access the system. While the sysadmins are staying away from the network, the users experiences many issues that nobody can fix. The government found some false positive with their sysadmin accidentally connecting the network and they were interrogated but noone new came up. Revolution and Art were working on scripts to spawns up new keys, new admin accesses and new allowed mac address and new allowed ip addresses. After a month, they noticed the issues were being resolved. They found that the stand-down was over and it was a false alarm in some feds' emails they hacked. They connected to the network and start cloning the entire network. But it was a trap. The handpicked trusted sysadmins were accessing the network through special ip addresses and mac addresses. The knights couldn't possibly know it since they've stay disconnected to the network for a while.

Act 9: Cyberwarfare
The knights noticed that the admins on the networks aren't the same as before and they knew the feds knew they were hacked. They warned Strawberry. Strawberry hid with the children in a bunker. K and C were killed by the feds trying to track Red Cat (Strawberry). The feds and top cybersecurity engineers try to shut the knights out of system and disturb their cloning the system.
