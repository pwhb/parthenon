I already have a character map for all the characters in the four novels and their relationship with each other. I also have a unified timeline for all the event across four novels and the age of each character at an event.

the anchor points I need to hold onto in phase 2 are:

1. !IMPORTANT the birth of Katy who's a daughter of Jenny Moore (she'll be a POV character in strawberries), Clara Foster is a friend of Jenny Moore (she'll be the second POV character in strawberries)
2. !JUST_REFERENCE the birth of Kim Melissa, who's a daughter of Kim Naomi, the ex lover of Alexei, the banker Seraphine despise
3. !IMPORTANT the birth of Song Luna, who's a daughter of Science and microbiologist Song Hye-jin
4. !IMPORTANT Red Tiger's new heists that Clara Foster will investigate for 9 years til the events in strawberries

the anchor points in phase 3 are

5. !IMPORTANT Science leaving Luna with her mother for safety while he has to intervene the nuclear world war
6. !IMPORTANT kidnapping of Katy by foreign intelligence to blackmail Jenny and her husband who are the counterintelligence agents
7. !IMPORTANT Politics recusing Katy and sending her to Strawberries Home for safety
8. !IMPORTANT Politics and Love giving birth to Parthe
9. !IMPORTANT the squire of War, Severus Reed, giving birth to Tango Reed

I missed another anchor point that's in phase 3.

!IMPORTANT the squire of War, Severus Reed, giving birth to Tango Reed

Parthe, Melissa, Luna and Tango are four POV protagonists in drifters. So their birth are important reference points in funogods. funogods is more like an epic war novel that connects the lore of mythical characters. strawberries is more like a direct sequel to alexandria with 11 years time gap. drifters can also be a direct sequel to strawberries with 22 years time gap.

let me start working on phase 2. it starts with the virus outbreak which Science notices to be man-made. Love will be independently combating the virus as a fresh medical school graduate in a volunteer team. Politics and Science will uncover a conspiracy located in the group of third world countries where patient zero was found. They have to do some heists to gather enough data to figure out that the squires have been looking for a way to monopolize mining rare mineral in these regions and the pandemic might not be a coincidence. While Politics and Seraphine remains in Atlas City to uncover the conspiracy, Science and Art will travel to East, where the third world countries that were about to be wiped out. Science will meet Song Hye-jin, a volunteer microbiologist combating the pandemics like Love does in West. Science would be too awkward but Art will act as a wingman. Science, Art and Song will form a volunteer vaccine research team which Love eventually joins from the other side of the world. Love and Seraphine will recognize each other and Love will become the fourth knight of kindness. Politics and Seraphine will break into the labs controlled by the squires to steal the original virus sample and the original vaccine that was no longer sufficient for the mutated virus in the targeted regions. Love, Science, Art and Song will use these data to work on the vaccine.

Can you check the plausibility in these vague outline of the outline? Feel free to act like a friend listening to my pitch. The core of the phase 2 is after phase 1, the team has enough financial resources and Donovan Price's encryption keys so they can access the squires' financial when they need to. They'll exploit these resources to reverse engineer the biohazard. Science and Art on the other side of the world will prepare the vaccine research team while Seraphine and Politics work on getting the data of the original virus and vaccine which will accelerate and save a couple year from vaccine research if it were to start from scratch.



Broken Mirror sounds like a good cocktail for the detective. It wouldn't be a popular drink because its name hurts your throat even when you hear it. Is there any alternative that reflects the same symbol without making your throat hurt? it's a drink after all.

I'll use Miss Marple for the polymath's drink. why are suggesting so much throat hurting sharp things for cocktail names?
