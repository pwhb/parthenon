I already have a character map for all the characters in the four novels and their relationship with each other. I also have a unified timeline for all the event across four novels and the age of each character at an event.

the anchor points I need to hold onto in phase 2 are:

1. !IMPORTANT the birth of Katy who's a daughter of Jenny Moore (she'll be a POV character in strawberries), Clara Foster is a friend of Jenny Moore (she'll be the second POV character in strawberries)
2. !JUST_REFERENCE the birth of Kim Melissa, who's a daughter of Kim Naomi, the ex lover of Alexei, the banker Seraphine despise
3. !IMPORTANT the birth of Song Luna, who's a daughter of Science and microbiologist Song Hye-jin
4. !IMPORTANT Red Tiger's new heists that Clara Foster will investigate for 9 years til the events in strawberries

the anchor points in phase 3 are

5. !IMPORTANT Science leaving Luna with her mother for safety while he has to intervene the nuclear world war
6. !IMPORTANT kidnapping of Katy by foreign intelligence to blackmail Jenny and her husband who are the counterintelligence agents
7. !IMPORTANT Politics recusing Katy and sending her to Strawberries Home for safety
8. !IMPORTANT Politics and Love giving birth to Parthe
9. !IMPORTANT the squire of War, Severus Reed, giving birth to Tango Reed

---

I missed another anchor point that's in phase 3.

!IMPORTANT the squire of War, Severus Reed, giving birth to Tango Reed

Parthe, Melissa, Luna and Tango are four POV protagonists in drifters. So their birth are important reference points in funogods. funogods is more like an epic war novel that connects the lore of mythical characters. strawberries is more like a direct sequel to alexandria with 11 years time gap. drifters can also be a direct sequel to strawberries with 22 years time gap.

let me start working on phase 2. it starts with the virus outbreak which Science notices to be man-made. Love will be independently combating the virus as a fresh medical school graduate in a volunteer team. Politics and Science will uncover a conspiracy located in the group of third world countries where patient zero was found. They have to do some heists to gather enough data to figure out that the squires have been looking for a way to monopolize mining rare mineral in these regions and the pandemic might not be a coincidence. While Politics and Seraphine remains in Atlas City to uncover the conspiracy, Science and Art will travel to East, where the third world countries that were about to be wiped out. Science will meet Song Hye-jin, a volunteer microbiologist combating the pandemics like Love does in West. Science would be too awkward but Art will act as a wingman. Science, Art and Song will form a volunteer vaccine research team which Love eventually joins from the other side of the world. Love and Seraphine will recognize each other and Love will become the fourth knight of kindness. Politics and Seraphine will break into the labs controlled by the squires to steal the original virus sample and the original vaccine that was no longer sufficient for the mutated virus in the targeted regions. Love, Science, Art and Song will use these data to work on the vaccine.

---

Can you check the plausibility in these vague outline of the outline? Feel free to act like a friend listening to my pitch. The core of the phase 2 is after phase 1, the team has enough financial resources and Donovan Faust's encryption keys so they can access the squires' financial when they need to. They'll exploit these resources to reverse engineer the biohazard. Science and Art on the other side of the world will prepare the vaccine research team while Seraphine and Politics work on getting the data of the original virus and vaccine which will accelerate and save a couple year from vaccine research if it were to start from scratch.

Broken Mirror sounds like a good cocktail for the detective. It wouldn't be a popular drink because its name hurts your throat even when you hear it. Is there any alternative that reflects the same symbol without making your throat hurt? it's a drink after all.

I'll use Miss Marple for the polymath's drink. why are suggesting so much throat hurting sharp things for cocktail names?

### The Fictional Nations of South America

This setup creates a clear dynamic: a fragile, resource-rich region threatened by external powers and defended by a regional hegemon on the rise.

#### 1. The Rare Earth Crescent (REC)

This is not a single country but a **geopolitical region** , akin to the "Guiana Shield" but with defined borders. It's a loose economic alliance of three small, developing nations, bound together by their shared mineral wealth and shared vulnerability.

- **The Republic of Veridia:** Located on the coast. The most developed of the three, with a capital city that is a bustling, chaotic port. Home to the administrative headquarters of foreign mining corporations. Patient Zero is likely found in a remote mining outpost in Veridia's interior jungle.
- **The Sovereign State of Patuá:** Landlocked and dominated by dense rainforest and massive, ancient tabletop mountains (tepuis). The most mineral-rich but least accessible country. Largely inhabited by indigenous communities. The heart of the "Crescent."
- **The Free Territory of Esmeralda:** A small nation on the Atlantic, known for its river systems. Struggles with illegal logging and mining. Serves as a primary conduit for the virus to spread into the wider region.

**Their Collective Challenge:** They possess over 60% of the world's known deposits of **Tantalum-X** (a fictional quantum-critical mineral), but lack the capital and technology to extract it themselves, making them dependent on and vulnerable to foreign multinationals.

**Veridian Liberation Army (VLA)** is the rebel group Galvarino

In my novel is a region called **The Rare Earth Crescent (REC)**. It's an area near the equator line in South America, composed of three countries;

- **The Republic of Veridia**
- **The Sovereign State of Patuá**
- **The Free Territory of Esmeralda**

REC lies in the border of three countries and it's rich in rare earth minerals that can be found only there of all places in the world. With the rapid advancement of technology, these minerals were eyed by the most powerful countries in the world. **The Democratic Federation of Santandería** is a large developed country in South America. While Veridia is under the influence of US, Patuá is under the influence of Santandería.

The core plot device of the novel is the parents of the protagonists worked for the independence of REC. Two of them were from Veridia; one of them was in Veridian Liberation Army (VLA), the rebel group, fighting against the puppeteer Veridian government under the control of US. The lover of the Veridian freedom fighter is a linguist who will work for the preservation of REC, in the lens of indigenous languages threatened by cultural suppression, systematic marginalization and the genocide of endangered ethnic groups. She will be assasinated by those that want to control REC.

Gray Finance is a software that encrypt a drive. It was created by Quentin Gray, the son of Damian Gray, when he was 17. When a client wants to work with Damian Gray, he would install Gray Finance on their system and it would encrypt the entire system except for a immutatable small partition named Phoenix module, which would be the only entry point to the system. A key is required to setup the software and Damian Gray uses a key called **universal key** to setup all of his client. When the installation is finished and the entire system is encrypted, three keys based on the checksum of the particular system is returned; **maker passphrase**, **checker passphrase**, and **special key**. Passphrases are usually memorized and keys are usually stored in hardware tokens. The interface that the financer can see is maker interface and that of the client is checker interface. Each interface can be accessed through its passphrase if the Phoenix module is unlocked.

There's also another key called **successor key** generated by **universal key**. Its only purpose is for the emergency case of losing **universal key**.

Phoenix module recognizes only three keys.

1. **universal key**: It is kept by the **financier**. This can unlock any system where Gray Finance is installed since he used the same key for every client.
2. **special key**: It's kept by the **client** but it's stored somewhere only the client knows and is usually never used. This can unlock the client's own system. Unlike the universal key which can only unlock Phoenix module, this key can also works both maker passphrase and checker passphrase.
3. **successor key**: It's kept in a safe deposit box that nobody except the financier and his successor know. This is only to be used when the universal key is lost. Once it's used, Phoenix module starts a countdown. It's a grace period specified during the setup. The default is 90 days. During the countdown, if universal key is used to unlock the system, the countdown stops and undo the takeover of successor. Otherwise, the successor key will become the universal key the next time successor key is used to access the system. The only way to bypass this grace period is with checker passphrase. During the process, a new successor key is returned.

Even though universal key and successor key can unlock Phoenix module, they can only decrypt the header files in the system. One can access the status of the assets maintained by the system, transaction history and transaction details. One can't execute or approve new transactions. The client is the only one that can execute a transaction. The client doesn't want to handle the specific details of the assets, such as shell companies, bank accounts binded to ghost identites, cryptocurrency, secret properties that governments can't track.

When the client want to make a transaction, the **passphrases** are usually used to create the transaction. The financier can use memorized **maker passphrase** to access maker interface where he can access immutatable details of the assets and design custom workflows. For most transactions, one of the designed workflow can be reused. The financier decides which workflow is the best for the requirements and they would initiate a transaction using **maker passphrase**. Only then a new pending transaction is created in the header files and everything else remains encrypted again.

While the header files are still decrypted by the universal key, the client can use memorized **checker passphrase** to access checker interface where they can see the detail of the requested transaction and approve and decline the transaction using **checker passphrase**. Only then the required parts of the system defined by the transaction are decrypted and the transaction is executed. Even though maker passphrase has more freedom to access the system, it doesn't have the final authority of check passphrase to execute any transaction or mutate the assets.

Either the client or the financier can be compromised for various reasons.

- If a thirdparty, eg a law enforcement agency, gains access to the financier's universal key, they would have no idea how it works. It doesn't do anything without the permission of the client to access their system.
- If the same goes with the client's system, without universal key or special key, the entire system is encrypted.
- If both the financier and one client were compromised, one might be able to unlock the Phoenix module, provided that they have universal key and access to the client's system. But only the header files that only the system can understand can be accessible. As long as, the financier doesn't give up his **maker passphrase for that client**, the system remained mostly encrypted and all the assets are safe. Even if maker passphrase is compromised, other clients are still safe. They can take their system down to avoid being investigated until it's safe.

- **Servizio Informazioni Nazionale (SIN)** - National Intelligence Service
- **Agência de Inteligência de Santandería **

Damian Gray had a system. He had a set of key phrases, each for one of his clients. I concluded he must have memorized the keys. Each key phrase was the only thing that gave him access to the encrypted system of each client. It was precisely how the most powerful people in the world managed their financial assets. A complete trust in a financier.

Actually the novel is all about a group of protagonists that serve no master but kindness working together to combat the most terrifying systemic horrors. the exploration of technology is just a subplot. I'm supposed to write four arcs.

1) GrayVault
2) Weeping Sickness (a man-made pandemic)
3) Fallout (world war 3 but with nuclear)
4) Silicon Fate

Arc 2 and 3 are centered around a South American region called Rare Earth Crescent, surrounded by three third-world countries. Many powerful countries have been eyeing on the Crescent for many decades. All of the protagonists' parents were from different countries fighting for the freedom of the Crescent. That's why they all were killed in the beginning by the very people the protagonists have to fight the rest of their lives. So they releases a virus in the Crescent so they can pretend to send aid to the region and then implicitly take control of the Crescent. Just like the powerful countries always create artificial conflicts in regions with valuable resources so they can justify their invasion. But the virus mutated in the equatorial climate unexpected and it got out of control. The protagonists have to work on the vaccine development to save the Crescent. A fictional country called Santandería would be the one funding the research most since it's the developed country neighbor to the two countries that contain the Crescent. That'd be arc 2.

Arc 3 starts with the western powers accusing Santandería of holding nuclear weapons which they actually do. A violent general in Santandería is actually working with the enemies of the protagonists so he followed their order to react aggressively creating a justification for the western powers to declare war against Santandería so they can invade the Crescent. Eastern powers like Russia and China will back Santandería simply to prevent Western powers gaining control of the Crescent. That'd be how it'd escalate to world war 3 where no side would surrender. The protagonists again would have to resolve this conflict.

After Arc 3, the enemies realized the omnipotent and omniscient force disrupting their plan wasn't so arbitrary after all. So they put all the chips on Quentin Gray's AI company to accelerate the development of the new Fate. Tech giant companies in their organization provide the user data they tracked and stored illegally. Eventually the AI will be indisputably most powerful AI in the world. It'll identify the protagonists and some of them will die. 97% accuracy is just a critical point. Any more power added would mean the end of free-will. So again the protagonists have to combat the new God to save the world from the end of free-will.

Except for Arc 1, every time they face a crisis they don't do it alone. For Arc 2, they work together with activists, doctors, virologists worldwide to simultaneously develop the vaccine and delay the invasion of the Crescent. They'd do the same in Arc 3. They'd do the same in Arc 4, with neurologists, psychologists, opensource communities, black hat hackers and so on.

The polymath is also arguing against the structure. In fact it's even more deeper. He renames Business to Conquest. The other three are almost synonymous. Why couldn't he tolerate the professor calling Conquest Business? Isn't Conquest a Business itself? Yes. He needs point it out that the thing that's composed of three forces isn't the final thing. It's merely one Horseman of Apocalypse. It's like watching only Star Wars Episode 1 and claiming the final villain is Darth Maul. He need
