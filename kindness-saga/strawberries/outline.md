# "do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs"

Act 1: Eden's Only Law
Strawberries Home is a sanctuary for the gifted children. "How do you know if a child is gifted?" you make ask. "All children are gifted," Strawberry would insists. It's an orphanage where children are raised on: Science (observation), Art (creation), Love (reflection), Revolution (acceptance). K is a mute girl that love nature. She communicates through hand signs and Tao Te Ching annotations. P is the first orphan, destined to become a computational biologist because of K's influence. P would've been a Set theorist if not for K. There's only one rule in Strawberries Homes "Thou shalt not lie"

Act 2: Red Tiger
The girl obsessed with pink and Science drop out of university. Science introduces Art, who can reverse-engineer anything to her.  To steal Eden back from God. Art shared plans for four heists that'd fund the orphanage. The girl successed the heists under the Red Tiger mask, which became her symbol. C, a genius detective, was tasked to hunt "Red Tiger". C is tormented by Red Tiger's perfection. After the heists stop, her hunt becomes a personal crusade.

Act 3: The Serpent in the Garden
Strawberry tells "bedtime stories" of Red Tiger's heist —veiled as fairy tales ("The Thief Who Stole the Moon")- only P notices the patterns. With the help of P, K learns the cruel truth:
Her parents (federal agents) died protecting her
The orphanage's finances are crumbling
Science and Art apologetically request Strawberry for a final heist. Only Strawberry remains off-grid enough to attempt it

Act 4: A Detective in Eden
C meets Strawberry by chance at a bookstore. When Strawberry's car breaks down, C brought her to Strawberries Home. She bonds with K, who resembles her deceased colleagues. C felt like home at the Strawberries Home. Through her brilliant deductions, she realized Strawberry is Red Tiger. And she already fell for her.

Act 5: Revelations
P connects Strawberry's stories to the Red Tiger legend. When K asked him about Strawberries Home's finance, P who's incapable to lie, reveal her about Red Tiger's identity. K, confronted Strawberry.
"I stole Eden back from God, knowing His wrath. I'm sorry I put you in harm's way."
She confesses to the orphans; some choose to leave.
Strawberry reveals K’s parents are alive—Love (P's dad) rescued her from kidnappers years ago. K decided to go back to her parents. Strawberry gives K the beer-stained Tao Te Ching from alexandria.
C returns to find K gone and the orphanage half-empty.
P reveals K reunited with her "resurrected" parents
C realizes they are her former coworkers, who are now suspicious of anyone connected to Red Tiger, including the hunter, C.

Act 6: The Bullet and the Letter
C visits K innocently, unaware K’s parents are surveillancing her.
Over tea, C slips: "I've hunted 'her' down for decades." K’s parents notices C knows Red Tiger isn't a man. They drag C into interrogation, threatening to kill P and Strawberry unless she confesses. K attacks her own parents—both C and K are gunned down by federal agents in the chaos.
K’s parents, still unaware of Strawberry’s identity, deliver her possessions to Strawberries Home
A letter inside the Tao Te Ching: "Eden was worth it."

Act 7: The Weight of Grief
At the funeral, P asks: "Was the heist worth their lives?"
Strawberry's silent headshake, hugging him.
