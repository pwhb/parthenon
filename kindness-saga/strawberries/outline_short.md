## Do Strawberries Dream of Sweetest (Saddest) Songs [strawberries]

## Prologue — Strawberry (POV)

Strawberries Home is a sanctuary for children the way a lighthouse is for ships: four pillars—Science, Art, Love, Politics—shape them, and one immutable rule holds them steady: **Thou shalt not lie.** Strawberry, always in pink, guides the household with soft authority. She visits her imprisoned professor and remembers, cheeks warm, a kiss that felt like both transgression and benediction.

---

Clara, Katy, and Parthe orbit that light in different orbits.

---

## Violent Delights — Katy (POV)

Katy moves through the orphanage in quiet hands and slow smiles. Mute since a trauma no one presses, she tends plants and animals with a tenderness that steadies the house. Her brightest friendship is with Parthe, the prime-number-obsessed child who, under Katy’s influence, will lean toward computational biology instead of set theory. Their ordinary days at Strawberries Home reveal the place’s wholesome rhythms and the way children grow into accidental destinies.

---

## Cold Cases — Clara (POV)

In Atlas City, Clara pieces together a life lived around an unsolved shadow: Red Tiger. The NexBank Heist was his first case; for five years Red Tiger executed flawless, symbolic crimes that left Clara stalking small, inverted clues—mirrored footage, a signature wink in an otherwise clean scene. Her professional method is procedural; her private life is an excavation of that first puzzle, one she can’t stop turning over.

---

## The Thief Who Stole the Moon — Katy (POV)

At night, Strawberry tells heist fables—romanticized origin stories about the thief who stole the moon. Afterwards, Parthe surfs criminal reports behind a VPN while Katy studies evolution. When Parthe asks Katy about her parents she answers with almost nothing; the question hangs between them like a seasonal fruit she isn’t ready to pick.

---

## Old Friends — Clara (POV)

The Guillotine bar holds a memory Clara can’t cleanse: friends lost in an espionage plot, a child gone missing, a funeral she could not attend because her friend's own unit absorbed the case. Those ghosts keep her tethered to work, wondering the missing child’s fate.

---

## Roots — Katy (POV)

Katy decides she wants to know about her parents. Parthe tells a story—of federal agents who died protecting a child whose profile matches Katy exactly. Strawberry confirms, gently, with a nod. A possibility settles in Katy like a new seed in fertile soil.

---

## Sun Diagnostics — Clara (POV)

Clara pores over the case files she never quite closed. Three peripheral crimes—pet store, convocation hall arson, Sun Diagnostics—sit like bones in a drawer. She re-reads Sun Diagnostics and feels the file’s edges press into her own history; it is the one that won’t let her be.

---

## Sun Herbal Shop — Katy (POV)

Strawberry tells the thief’s origin tale: she robbed Sun Herbal Shop that refused aid to the poor. Parthe thinks the fable mirrors the real Sun Diagnostics case; in the children’s world, myth and news blur until the moral is all that’s left.

---

## Brother — Clara (POV)

On a holiday, Clara visits her brother’s grave—he was a casualty of gang life and the only family she had before her work. Back home, the Red Tiger board dominates her walls; tired, grieving, she tries to masturbate and fails. The knock at her door is Red Tiger himself. Fear curdles into something else when she lets him in: a tense, wordless intimacy. She handcuffs him, they make a private, messy covenant, and when she unmasks him at climax she sees her brother’s face—an impossible revelation that collapses desire, grief, and the grotesque comfort of reunion into one unbearable moment.

---

## Connection — Katy (POV)

Katy reads the Tao Te Ching—the same edition Strawberry once received from her professor—and talks evolution with Parthe: organisms, energy flow, systems. Parthe turns it playful and dark: if everything connects, then taboo like incest becomes simply another link.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

Coworkers mock Clara’s obsession with Red Tiger and suggest following the money. Clara has already tracked the trail; not all theft is about cash—some is message. Sun Diagnostics reads like a credo rather than a ledger. She requests redacted data from Everwell Insurance and Sun Diagnostics and is rebuffed; the refusal feels like a personal slight.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

Katy signs explanations of metabolism to Parthe, who abstracts them into an idea: Strawberries Home as organism and the children as organs. Curious about funding, Parthe looks for donation traces and finds a suspicious absence—paperwork too clean, ads too polished, a virtual footprint that smells faintly of artifice.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

A chance meeting at Alexandria bookstore brings Clara to Strawberry’s world. When Strawberry’s car breaks down, Clara drives her to Strawberries Home and meets Katy. The orphanage’s warmth erodes Clara’s professional armor; for the first time in years she feels at ease somewhere not defined by case files.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

Strawberry’s stories shift to the money-lender heist; Parthe is quietly tracing NexBank in his research. He sees the stories as retellings of Red Tiger’s legend and keeps the realization to himself.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

Katy’s age matches the missing child of Clara’s old friends. Passed out in her files again, Clara confronts the impossible: Red Tiger shows up, she greets him like a lover, and when she unmasks him this time the face is Strawberry’s. The moment collapses the professional and the personal into a secret they share in breath and skin.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

Guest teachers—Art and Science—return to the orphanage. Parthe runs and hugs them. Science notices the Tao Te Ching on Katy’s desk; Strawberry and Science exchange a private memory of their past. The visit is warm, quick—adults orbiting a quiet, protected child.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

At the bookstore again, Clara asks casually about ties between Strawberry and the Arsonist professor; Strawberry admits he was her teacher. Clara reads his papers and recognizes a brilliant mind and, in past records, a former student—Seraphine Clair—whose disappearance coincides with the arson case.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

Strawberry is absent. Parthe, now studying cryptography, shows Katy how to hide messages; he suggests the key phrase “taoteching.” Katy finds a better one in her Tao Te Ching—“We met in Alexandria”.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

Clara—unable to resist—uses forged IDs to visit the arsonist in prison. Guest logs reveal a name: Strawberry Starling. The convict’s guarded answers and small tells convince Clara Seraphine is Strawberry. The evidence lines up with an unsettling clarity: a brilliant student who loved her professor.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

A fall in the woods sends Katy to the hospital with a broken hand. Parthe runs for help; Strawberry rushes them to Atlas General. The injury is mundane and catastrophic in equal measure: a child’s fragility pulled into the light.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

Clara digs deeper: Seraphine’s name change, a funeral record for a father whose death aligns with Sun Diagnostics. At the hospital she finds records of an insurance denial by Everwell—Sun Diagnostics’ parent—timing that could be motive enough for vengeance. The thought that Strawberry might be Red Tiger moves from fantasy to working hypothesis.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

Strawberry struggles at the hospital checkout—no cash accepted—and calls Art to help cover bills. Small bureaucracies prick the edges of their shelter.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

Paperwork at Strawberries Home is too tidy. Donation requests exist but read like performances. Clara’s instincts sharpen into suspicion; Strawberry is fit, present where needed, and the facts, aligned, point toward her. She cannot confront Strawberry outright.

---

## (Katy) — Katy (POV)

Confronted by Katy’s bluntness and Parthe’s uncompromising truthfulness, Strawberry confesses. She tells them she stole “Eden back from God,”—an almost mythic framing for targeted heists against institutions she judged morally bankrupt. She gives the children the choice to stay or leave; some leave, most stay. Strawberry reveals a harder truth: Katy’s parents are alive but faked their deaths. Strawberry gives Katy the Tao Te Ching as a talisman for the next stage.

---

## (Clara) — Clara (POV)

Clara returns to Strawberries Home and finds only a few children—Parthe among them. Katy has rejoined her biological parents. Strawberry is absent. Parthe doesn’t betray Strawberry; he reveals only that Katy is well and sends an email update. Clara reads the child like an open calculation: he knows more than he says, and the loyalty in his eyes confirms what she has long suspected. The web tightens between professor, arson, denied insurance claims, and a woman in pink who will not lie.

---

## XXVI — Katy (POV)

Katy settles into a quiet life with her parents. She writes to Parthe and opens his playful email of cat memes, then decodes a hidden image with the key "airdnaxelanitemew." The message is urgent but gentle: Clara visited Strawberries Home, he shares her Katy’s address, and he is a fed hunting Red Tiger—but she likely won’t harm Strawberry. Parthe cautions Katy not to delete the mail; the subtext is protection and kindness. Katy exhales and keeps living.

---

## XXVII — Clara (POV)

Called away from a visit to Katy, Clara is pulled into a new case: NexBank’s cold-wallet vault—six-hundred-year-old, high-security—has been emptied of cryptocurrency. She suspects Red Tiger and gives her contact to cyber forensics. Back home, paranoia takes over: she sweeps for bugs, uses fake IDs, and moves through the city like a ghost to erase traces. She visits the prison and the hospital, deleting Seraphine’s records from creaky systems. A single ephemeral text arrives: someone claiming to be Seraphine’s friend—Parthe’s mother—thanking her and confirming she erased the hospital logs too. The message self-deletes.

---

## XXVIII — Katy (POV)

News of the NexBank heist reaches Katy. Parthe’s next encoded message reads plainly in one image: “code red.” Clara is being investigated by Katy’s parents; Clara is trustworthy to them in some way, but Katy’s parents are not aligned with Strawberries Home. The hidden plea: stay vigilant. Katy pretends normalcy and writes under the covers.

---

## XXIX — Clara (POV)

Clara purges her files—burning documents, swapping drives, destroying evidence that ties Strawberry to Red Tiger. She tries to live normally, then visits Katy’s house. There she meets Katy’s parents: Clara’s deceased colleagues alive and affectionate. The visit curdles fast. A slip—Clara says “her”—reveals her belief about Red Tiger, and tension spikes. Tea, refused by Katy, becomes charged. Katy’s father draws a gun and accuses Clara; he demands she hand over everything she knows or he’ll authorize a raid on Strawberries Home. Clara tries to defuse things, then attacks to disarm him. A struggle erupts: Katy’s mother draws a weapon; Clara disarms the father and forces him to call for containment. As the call goes through, task-force teams converge. In the chaos Clara hides and fights back; Katy, panicked, attacks her mother with a pan to help. The house is surrounded. In the crossfire as they cling together, Clara, Katy, and Katy’s mother are executed by the task force’s assault.

---

## XXX — Epilogue — Strawberry (POV)

At the funeral, Strawberry dresses in pink and holds the brittle, impossible quiet of loss. She and Parthe stand before Katy’s small grave. Katy’s father, still unaware of Strawberry’s true identity, apologizes and offers the girl’s things; Parthe withdraws the Tao Te Ching and finds Katy’s faint annotation: “Eden was worth it.” He asks Strawberry if the heists were worth those lives. Strawberry only shakes her head and draws Parthe into a silence that is both answer and absolution.
