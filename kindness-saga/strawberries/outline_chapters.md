---

## XVII. (Clara's POV)

Clara meets Strawberry again at the bookstore again. She has been visiting in her leisure because it was mentioned by the Arsonist's case files.

Clara agrees. she tells him she wants to know if there's anything he can remember about Sun Diagnostics Heist, because it's one of the three cases that itches her mind. he says whoever stole from them is a good person. she asks him about his relationship with his students. he says they love him, Clara nods, as it aligns with the interviews of the students. she asks him about Seraphine specifically, whom might be Strawberry as she deduced. he says she's a good person and refuses to elaborate. but she sees a hint in his facial expressions that confirm she's Strawberry.

---

## XXIII. (Clara's POV)

Clara notices all the paperwork around Strawberries Home is too perfect to be true. There's enough paperwork to justify everything. There's just enough donation requests for the funding but they don't look like they're feeding on mercy. there's a sense of subtle pride. it'd be rude to ask Strawberry directly about the orphanage's fundings. she looks into the case files again and recalls Strawberry worked out enough to have the same build as Red Tiger. everything is pointing that Strawberry aka Seraphine is Red Tiger. even real cases she solved doesn't fit this much.

--

## XXIV. (Katy's POV)

Clara visits Strawberries Home. she only sees Parth and a few other children. she asks Parth about Katy and Strawberry. Parth tells her Katy returned to her "resurrected" parents. he doesn't know where Strawberry is because she didn't tell him. Clara trusts him. she asks him why she sees only a few children. Parth answers it's because only a few children are in the orphanage. she clarifies her question; where did other children go? Parth answers they went to other orphanages. she is almost about to ask him why but she realizes it's too cruel to interrogate a child. she already knows Parth knows Strawberry is Red Tiger. she can see it in his eyes. she also senses that he neither approves nor disapproves Red Tiger. but he didn't leave Strawberries Home unlike Katy. she only tells him he must love Strawberry so much that he's here. Parth nods. Clara asks Parth if he can share where Katy lives now. Parth shows her an email from Katy. she's doing great at her parents' home.

---

## XXVI. (Katy's POV)

Katy is doing well her home. she writes to Parth asking how he's doing. her parents get home after a late night at work, she has dinner with them. after the dinner, Katy received an email from Parth. he says everything is normal and he misses her. in the attachments are some cat memes. but she knows Parth. he's not lying but he's not telling anything meaningful in the mail body. she used the key "airdnaxelanitemew" the reverse of "wemetinalexandria" to decode the images and find a readable message in one image, "Clara visited us today. i shared her your address. i found out she is a fed. she's been hunting Red Tiger for a decade. but i think she already knows Strawberry is Red Tiger but she doesn't do anything to hurt her. i believe she's safe for us. don't delete the email. if you're under watch, it'll attract unnecessary suspicion. may we all be kind." Katy sighs.

---

## XXVII. (Clara's POV)

on her way to visit Katy, Clara is urgently summoned to her work to investigate the new case. the Nexance crypto exchange's crypto in the cold wallets kept in 600-year old bank facility's vault owned by NexBank were stolen. She can imagine Strawberry breaking into the vault. it's her design. they asks her if it's Red Tiger and she admits she thinks so. she gives her email to the cyber forensics team to share her when they find the results after x-ray and accessing the hardware wallets.

when she gets home, she paranoidly looks for surveillance devices in her apartment. she finds none. she takes fake IDs hidden in her vault. she takes the stairs to avoid cctv and gets out of the building. she takes different kind of transportations to hide her track. when she's sure nobody is following her. she goes to the prison and shows them her fake IDs to look into prison records. she removes all the logs of Seraphine. she also hacks the prison network and deletes all the logs of Seraphine, it is a legacy system that isn't secured well.

and then she takes different kind of transportation again and goes to the hospital. she uses fake ID to access the physical records to erase Seraphine's father's records. but they are all erased already. it takes her a while to hack the hospital network but as she expected she finds no trace of Seraphine's father's records. she received a text message "Hi, I just saw you at the hospital. I'm Seraphine's friend. Parth is my son. I took care of Seraphine's dad's records. I even erased your search history just now. Thank you for your kindness. Please stay safe. Love" within 30 seconds, the message is deleted itself.

---

## XXVIII. code red (Katy's POV)

Katy reads about the NexBank crypto heist. she receives an email from Parth again. he tells her about Clara visiting them in the email body this time. he asks her if she already visited her. the tone is very innocent. as if he doesn't know Clara is the detective that's working on Red Tiger's last heist. as if he's not aware of it. as if he's a normal child. but Katy knows him. she decode the images one by one and found the message in one, "code red. your parents are investigating Clara. Clara is on our side but your parents aren't. please stay vigilant. may we all be kind." Katy tries to look normal and write a letter under the blanket.

---

## XXIX. violent ends (Clara's POV)

Clara burns all the real clues that might reveal Strawberry's identity. She replaces them with unrelated real informations. she also replaces her hard drives and destory them. she takes a moment to check if she missed something. when she's sure, she did everything she can. she tries to relax and live normal. if she were under watch, the normal thing to do is to visit Katy.

Clara visits Katy's home and is surprised to see her deceased colleagues as Katy's parents. they hug her and tell her they're happy to see her. she tells them she missed them so much. they talk about their lives. Katy's parents notice Clara isn't mentioning Red Tiger at all even though there was a huge case in the news. They ask her if she's give up on the tiger. Clara shakes her head. "of course not. I'm sure I'll get her one day." Clara notices she slips "her" but pretends to hide her anxiety. Katy's parents pretend to not notice it. but Katy realizes Clara made the fatal mistake. Katy's mom excuses herself to go to the kitchen. Katy's dad keeps asking her about how she met Katy. Clara says it must be destiny because she's always loved Katy ever since she was born. Clara tells them she believes Katy'll be able to talk again. Katy's mom brought some tea for Katy and Clara. Katy refuses to drink it. Clara looks at them awkwardly. Katy says she wants to go to bed now.

they asks Clara to drinkt the tea but she tries to refuses it, suspecting it might be drugged. she makes excuse to go home since she's too tired from working on Red Tiger's last heist. Katy's dad pulls his gun from a shelf and points at Clara. Katy's mom asks her to calm down and share them information she has on Red Tiger. Clara shakingly begs them to let her go at first but she realizes it's no use. She tells them she'll be interrogated willingly. Katy's dad tells her to not waste their time or he'll ask the task force to wipe out Strawberries Home which Clara obviously cares about. Clara tells them they know Strawberries Home is innocent because it raised Katy. Katy's mom nods and says she knows. She tells Clara to give up on Red Tiger or innocent people will lost their lives. Clara runs towards Katy's dad and attack him to take his gun. Katy's mom pulls out her gun and point at Clara. Clara's pointing the gun at Katy's dad. Clara says she still wants to believe they're her friends and she drops the gun first. Katy's dad takes his gun back and points it at her. he then dial his phone to call his superior. "We have enough evidence to believe Clara knows something about Red Tiger. she's refusing to give us helpful information." he looks at Clara and tells her it's her last chance to give up on Red Tiger or she'll request authorization to storm Strawberries Home. Clara shakes her head and kneels. "Hand me to an interrogator." He warns for the last time "Please give us anything helpful." and then begin to speak into the phone. They are stunned as Katy attacks her mom with a pan from behind. Clara takes Katy's dad's gun again and points at him. He sees pure anger in her eyes. He surrenders and speaks into the phone, "We've cornered her in my residence. Please arrange to contain her and interrogate her. It's good for now," and drops the phone. He asks her to drop the gun and surrender peacefully because the task force should've surrounded the home by now. She's hesitant at first but she begins to remove the bullets to drop the gun. But the task force storms into the home and starts shooting at her as she's holding their agents hostages. Clara hides under the table and shoots them back. Katy jumps over her mom and runs towards her with a pan. Another team storms the house from behind. amid the chaos Katy's mom wakes up, groans and crawls towards her daughter to protect her and her friend.

## XXX. epilogue (Strawberry's POV)

Strawberry is dressing up for the funeral. She and Parth attends Katy's funeral. Still unaware of Strawberry's identity, Katy's dad ask them if they want Katy's possessions for other children. He keeps them in a box in his car. He doesn't know what to do with them but it's too depressing to look at them. He apologizes to Strawberry if he sounded like he was blaming her for the death of Katy and Katy's mom. Strawberry assures him to not worry about it. Parth grabs the box lovingly and takes Tao Te Ching out. he finds some hand signs on the front page under "we met in alexandria". he quietly tells Strawberry Katy wrote "Eden was worth it."

After the funeral, Parth asks Strawberry the unbearable question: "Was the heist worth their lives?" Strawberry answers with only a silent headshake as she pulls him into a hug.
