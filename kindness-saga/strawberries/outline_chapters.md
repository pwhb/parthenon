## I. prologue (Strawberry's POV)

the prologue starts with Strawberry introducing the reader to Strawberries Home. It is a sanctuary for gifted children. "How do you know if a child is gifted?" you might ask. "All children are gifted," Strawberry would insist. It's an orphanage that raises its children on four pillars: Science (observation), Art (creation), Love (reflection), and Revolution (acceptance). There is only one rule at Strawberries Home: "Thou shalt not lie." Strawberry wears pink to visit her professor who's now in prison. she smiles when she embarrassingly recalls the kiss.

---

## II. violent delights (K's POV)

We will explore the wholesomeness of the orphanage in POV of K. K is a mute girl; hinted that some trauma caused her mutism. K loves plants and animals. her best friend is P, the child obsessed with prime numbers. He is the first orphan, destined to become a computational biologist because of K's influence. P would've been a Set Theorist if not for K.

---

## . (C's POV)

We'll expore bureaucratic procedural work of federal agents in POV of C. C is detective that never moved on from the Red Tiger; the culprit behind the case she took as her first assignment, NexBank Heist, during her academy years. Red Tiger continued to execute flawless heists. It took her years alone to deduce some cases like PM's residence or a general's mansion are perpetrated by Red Tiger. She wouldn't be able to even do it, if not for the subtle clues left by Red Tiger himself.

---

## . (K's POV)

Strawberry tells the children a bedtime story about "The Thief Who Stole the Moon", a series of heist stories she's been telling them. P used a vpn to looked for criminal news, while K is studying evolution. P asks her if she remembers anything about her parents. she answers not much. he asks her if she wants to. she's hesitant.

---

## . (C's POV)

C visits the bar near her academy. she recalls she used to drink there with her friends couple, until her friend got pregnant. they joined Counterintelligence Division while she joined Violent Crimes Unit under Criminal Investigative Division. her friends died during a espionage plot and their child has been missing since. it feels so unreal. she couldn't even attend the funeral as their department took over their case marked as top priorty.

---

## . (K's POV)

K tells P she wants to learn about her parents. P smiles at her and tells her about some brave federal agents that died protecting their child. the child's profile and age exactly fits K's. K asks Strawberry if she's the child in that case for confirmation and Strawberry nods.

---

## . (C's POV)

C is stll looking at the board in her apartment about Red Tiger. she recalls failing to profile Red Tiger, she looked for other cases in the vicinity of NexBank heist in the past and found 3 interesting cases; one is a pet store heist, second is Convocation Hall arsonist and the third Sun Diagnostics heist. she rereads the case file titled Sun Diagnostics Heist. it feels too personal.

---

## . (K's POV)

Strawberry tells the children about the origin story of the thief. the thief broke into Sun Herbal Shop that didn't help the poor patients. The setting is masked in an acient setting but P suspects it somehow mirrors a case he found interesting; Sun Diagnostics Heist.

she passed out being exhausted. she hears a knock on the door and opens it. it's red tiger. she is scared to let him in but she eventually does. she doesn't understand why she finds his chest sexy. without speaking a word, she finds herself connected to this man. she caresses his chest. he hugs her and put her on the bed. she handcuffs his hands to the bed and has sex with him. at the climax, she put his mask off and sees her brother's face. she cums while crying on her brother's chest.

---

## . (K's POV)

K is reading Tao Te Ching, the same one strawberry got from her teacher. she tells P how it aligns with evolution, how we're all connected. P jokes that if everyone is connected, incest is just normal relationship.

---

## . (C's POV)

C is ridiculed by her coworkers for not moving on Red Tiger. one of them suggests he'd track the money's trace because money is always the target. C nods. she already tracked the money years ago. she isn't convinced Red Tiger is stealing for money. some are symbolic. some are artistic. Sun Diagnostics Heist is the only one that feels authentic. she looks for her past emails, requesting redacted data of the customers from Sun Diagnostics and its parent company Everwell Insurance. they refused to help the case.

---

## . (K's POV)

K explains P about metabolism in sign language; how every life form needs energy input output to process and live. P turns it into an abstract thought experiments. Strawberries Home can be an organism and they're the organ. he tells K about it. he wonders where the funds for the orphanage comes from. using a secure connection, he looks for the donation ads and doesn't find convincingly enough. they look too clean compared to messy real donation ads. looking into it more, he realizes more and more that their home is virtually inexistent.

---

## . (C's POV)

By chance, C meets Strawberry at a bookstore named, "Alexandria". When Strawberry's car breaks down, C asks her to let her drive her to Strawberries Home. There, C meets and bonds with K, who reminds her of deceased colleagues. For the first time in years, C feels at home.

---

## . (K's POV)

Strawberry tells the children about the heist of money-lenders. K sees P doing research about NexBank. [P realizes it's a retelling of NexBank Heist. P connects Strawberry's stories to the Red Tiger legend. but he keeps it to himself.]

---

## . (C's POV)

C realizes that K is about the same age as her friend's daughter. she passed out in the case files again. she hears a knock and finds Red Tiger at the door. she hugs him like a sad girl waiting for her lover. she kisses him on the mask and then removes it. she's not surprised to see it's Strawberry behind the mask this time. Strawberry kisses her back and they have sex.

---

## . (K's POV)

A girl named Poetry and a guy named Science visit Strawberries Home. they used to visit them for guest classes. the guy takes look at Tao Te Ching on K's desk and smiles at her. Strawberry asks him if he remembers how he used to demands rigorousness from the professor. Science smiles and nods. this time they just talk to Strawberry in private without teaching the children.

---

## . (C's POV)

C meets Strawberry again at the bookstore again. She has been visiting in her leisure because it was mentioned by the Arsonist's case files. C causally asks her about K. she also asks her if she doesn't mind, by any chance, whether she got to know the arsonist. Strawberry answers he was her professor. C says it's a shame, she reads some of his paper and knows he has a brilliant mind.

---

## . (K's POV)

K can't find Strawberry at Strawberries Home. she asks P and he tells her she's visiting her mentor again. P is studying cryptography. he seems to recalls something and tells her how to decode a media file in case he has to send her a secret message. she asks him what should be the key phrase. he suggests "taoteching". K remmebers something and opens the book. "we met in alexandria" on the first page. P smiles and nods.

---

## . (C's POV)

C takes fake IDs from her personal vault in her apartment and goes to the prison to interview the arsonist. she's not sure if it's for collecting data for Red Tiger or her crush Strawberry. she notices a name in the guest records. Seraphine. but it's natural since she read about her in the case files; she's the student that defends the professor and quits school about the time of the case. she asks him how he's doing. he politely tells her how he's doing but he bluntly continues, there's nothing more to investigate in his case. C agrees. she tells him she wants to know if there's anything he can remember about Sun Diagnostics Heist, because it's one of the three cases that itches her mind. he says whoever stole from them is a good person. she asks him about his relationship with his students. he says they love him, C nods, as it aligns with the interviews of the students. she asks him about Seraphine specifically, whom might be Strawberry as she deduced. he says she's a good person and refuses to elaborate. but she sees a hint in his facial expressions that confirm she's Strawberry.

---

## . (K's POV)

K is playing in the woods. she climbs a tree, falls and break her hand. P runs to Strawberry and she takes them to Atlas General Hospital. [I might change this to another injury that requires sending K to the hospital.]

---

## . (C's POV)

realizing that she fell for Strawberry, C looks into her background as Seraphine. she founds a funeral record of Seraphine's father. she suddenly realizes the time of his death is so close to Sun Diagnostics Heist. she goes to the hospital to looks for his records. she learns Seraphine's father's insurrance claim was denied by Everwell Insurance, a part of which, Sun Diagnostics was. she knows it'd be a stretch to suspect Strawberry aka Seraphine to be Red Tiger. but she thinks it has enough merits to follow deeper.

---

## . (K's POV)

K sees C at the hospital. too busy with her own business, C doesn't notice her. Strawberry has trouble checking out at the hospital because they doesn't accept cash. She calls her friend, Poetry to pay for the bills with her credit card.

---

## . (C's POV)

C notices all the paperwork around Strawberries Home is too perfect to be true. There's enough paperwork to justify everything. There's just enough donation requests for the funding but they don't look like they're feeding on mercy. there's a sense of subtle pride. it'd be rude to ask Strawberry directly about the orphanage's fundings. she looks into the case files again and recalls Strawberry worked out enough to have the same build as Red Tiger. everything is pointing that Strawberry aka Seraphine is Red Tiger. even real cases she solved doesn't fit this much.

--

## . (K's POV)

K suddenly wants to knows about finances of the orphanage. P - incapable of lying - reveals Strawberry's secret identity. K confronts Strawberry. she confesses: "I stole Eden back from God, knowing His wrath. It breaks my heart that I put you in harm's way." She tells the orphans the truth and gives them a choice to leave. Though hesitant, some choose to leave but they all agree to protect her secret. Strawberry reveals K's parents are actually alive but unaware that K was rescued from the kidnappers years ago by Revolution (P's father) faked their death for their missions. K decides to reunite with them. As parting gift, Strawberry gives K, Tao Te Ching.

---

## . (C's POV)

C visits Strawberries Home. she only sees P and a few other children. she asks P about K and Strawberry. P tells her K returned to her "resurrected" parents. he doesn't know where Strawberry is because she didn't tell him. C trusts him. she asks him why she sees only a few children. P answers it's because only a few children are in the orphanage. she clarifies her question; where did other children go? P answers they went to other orphanages. she is almost about to ask him why but she realizes it's too cruel to interrogate a child. she already knows P knows Strawberry is Red Tiger. she can see it in his eyes. she also senses that he neither approves nor disapproves Red Tiger. but he didn't leave Strawberries Home unlike K. she only tells him he must love Strawberry so much that he's here. P nods. C asks P if he can share where K lives now. P shows her an email from K. she's doing great at her parents' home.

---

## . (K's POV)

K is doing well her home. she writes to P asking how he's doing. her parents get home after a late night at work, she has dinner with them. after the dinner, K received an email from P. he says everything is normal and he misses her. in the attachments are some cat memes. but she knows P. he's not lying but he's not telling anything meaningful in the mail body. she used the key "airdnaxelanitemew" the reverse of "wemetinalexandria" to decode the images and find a readable message in one image, "C visited us today. i shared her your address. i found out she is a fed. she's been hunting Red Tiger for a decade. but i think she already knows Strawberry is Red Tiger but she doesn't do anything to hurt her. i believe she's safe for us. don't delete the email. if you're under watch, it'll attract unnecessary suspicion. may we all be kind." K sighs.

---

## . (C's POV)

on her way to visit K, C is urgently summoned to her work to investigate the new case. the Nexance crypto exchange's crypto in the cold wallets kept in 600-year old bank facility's vault owned by NexBank were stolen. She can imagine Strawberry breaking into the vault. it's her design. they asks her if it's Red Tiger and she admits she thinks so. she gives her email to the cyber forensics team to share her when they find the results after x-ray and accessing the hardware wallets.

when she gets home, she paranoidly looks for surveillance devices in her apartment. she finds none. she takes fake IDs hidden in her vault. she takes the stairs to avoid cctv and gets out of the building. she takes different kind of transportations to hide her track. when she's sure nobody is following her. she goes to the prison and shows them her fake IDs to look into prison records. she removes all the logs of Seraphine. she also hacks the prison network and deletes all the logs of Seraphine, it is a legacy system that isn't secured well.

and then she takes different kind of transportation again and goes to the hospital. she uses fake ID to access the physical records to erase Seraphine's father's records. but they are all erased already. it takes her a while to hack the hospital network but as she expected she finds no trace of Seraphine's father's records. she received a text message "Hi, I just saw you at the hospital. I'm Seraphine's friend. P is my son. I took care of Seraphine's dad's records. I even erased your search history just now. Thank you for your kindness. Please stay safe. Love" within 30 seconds, the message is deleted itself.

---

## . (K's POV)

K reads about the NexBank crypto heist. she receives an email from P again. he tells her about C visiting them in the email body this time. he asks her if she already visited her. the tone is very innocent. as if he doesn't know C is the detective that's working on Red Tiger's last heist. as if he's not aware of it. as if he's a normal child. but K knows him. she decode the images one by one and found the message in one, "code red. your parents are investigating C. C is on our side but your parents aren't. please stay vigilant. may we all be kind." K tries to look normal and write a letter under the blanket.

---

## . violent ends (C's POV)

C burns all the real clues that might reveal Strawberry's identity. She replaces them with unrelated real informations. she also replaces her hard drives and destory them. she takes a moment to check if she missed something. when she's sure, she did everything she can. she tries to relax and live normal. if she were under watch, the normal thing to do is to visit K.

C visits K's home and is surprised to see her deceased colleagues as K's parents. they hug her and tell her they're happy to see her. she tells them she missed them so much. they talk about their lives. K's parents notice C isn't mentioning Red Tiger at all even though there was a huge case in the news. They ask her if she's give up on the tiger. C shakes her head. "of course not. I'm sure I'll catch her one day." C notices she slips "her" but pretends to hide her anxiety. K's parents pretend to not notice it. but K realizes C made the fatal mistake. K's mom excuses herself to go to the kitchen. K's dad keeps asking her about how she met K. C says it must be destiny because she's always loved K ever since she was born. C tells them she believes K'll be able to talk again. K's mom brought some tea for K and C. K refuses to drink it. C looks at them awkwardly. K says she wants to go to bed now. they asks C to drinkt the tea but she tries to refuses it. she makes excuse to go home since she's too tired from working on Red Tiger's last heist. K's dad pulls his gun from a shelf and points at C. K's mom asks her to calm down and share them information she has on Red Tiger. C shakingly begs them to let her go at first but she realizes it's no use. she tells them she'll be interrogated willingly. K's dad tells her to not waste their time or he'll ask the task force to wipe out Strawberries Home which C obviously cares about. C tells them they know Strawberries Home is innocent because it raises K. K's mom nods and says she knows. she tells C to give up on Red Tiger or innocent people will lost their lives. C runs towards K's dad and attack him to take his gun. K's mom pulls out her gun and point at C. C's pointing the gun at K's dad. C says she still wants to believe they're her friends and she drops the gun first. K's dad takes it back and points it at her. he then dial his phone to call his superior. "We have enough evidence to believe C knows something about Red Tiger. she's refusing to give us helpful information." he looks at C and tells her it's her last chance to give up on Red Tiger or she'll request authorization to storm Strawberries Home. C shakes her head and kneels. "Hand me to an interrogator." He warns for the last time "Please give us anything helpful." and then begin to speak into the phone. they are stunned as K attacks her mom with a pan from behind. C takes K's dad's gun again and points at him. he sees pure anger in her eyes. he surrenders and speaks into the phone, "We've cornered her in my residence. Please arrange to contain her and interrogate her. It's good for now." and drops the phone. He asks her to drop the gun and surrender peacefully because the task force should've surrounded the home by now. She's hesitant at first but she begins to remove the bullets to drop the gun. but the task force storms into the home and starts shooting. C hides under the table and shoots them back. K jumps over her mom and runs towards her with a pan. another team storms the house from behind. amid the chaos K's mom wakes up, groans and crawls towards her daughter to protect her and her friend. but determined to not let C escape at all cost, all three of them were gunned down by the task force.

## . epilogue (Strawberry's POV)

Strawberry is dressing up for the funeral. She and P attends K's funeral. Still unaware of Strawberry's identity, K's dad ask them if they want K's possessions for other children. He keeps them in a box in his car. He doesn't know what to do with them but it's depressing to look at them. he apologizes to Strawberry if he sounded like he was blaming her for the death of K and K's mom. Strawberry assures him to not worry about it. P grabs the box lovingly and takes Tao Te Ching out. he finds some hand signs on the front page under "we met in alexandria". he quietly tells Strawberry she wrote "Eden was worth it."

After the funeral, P asks Strawberry the unbearable question: "Was the heist worth their lives?" Strawberry answers with only a silent headshake as she pulls him into a hug.
