## I. Prologue (Strawberry's POV)

The prologue opens with Strawberry introducing the reader to Strawberries Home—a sanctuary for gifted children. "How do you know if a child is gifted?" you might ask. "All children are gifted," Strawberry would insist. It's an orphanage that raises its children on four pillars: Science (abstraction), Art (restructuring), Love (reflection), and Politics (acceptance). There is only one rule at Strawberries Home: "Thou shalt not lie." Strawberry wears pink to visit her professor, now imprisoned. She smiles when she embarrassingly recalls the kiss.

---

## II. Violent Delights (Katy's POV)

We explore the wholesomeness of the orphanage through Katy's POV. Katy is a mute girl—it's hinted that trauma caused her mutism. Katy loves plants and animals. Her best friend is Parthe, the child obsessed with prime numbers. He is the first orphan, destined to become a computational biologist because of Katy's influence. Parthe would have been a set theorist if not for Katy.

---

## III. Cold Cases (Clara's POV)

We explore the bureaucratic procedural work of federal agents through Clara's POV. Clara is a detective profiler who never moved on from Red Tiger—the culprit behind the case she took as her first assignment, the NexBank Heist, during her intern days. Red Tiger continued to execute flawless heists for only 2 years. It took her years to deduce that cases like the PM's residence or a general's mansion were perpetrated by Red Tiger. She wouldn't have been able to solve them without those she believes to be the subtle clues left by Red Tiger himself; like a mirrored image in security footage.

---

## IV. The Thief Who Stole the Moon (Katy's POV)

Strawberry tells the children a bedtime story about "The Thief Who Stole the Moon." She has been telling them a series of heist stories. Parthe uses a VPN to search for criminal news, while Katy studies evolution. Parthe asks her if she remembers anything about her parents. She answers, "Not much." He asks if she wants to. She hesitates.

---

## V. Old Friends (Clara's POV)

Clara visits the "Guillotine" bar. She recalls drinking there with her friends—a couple—until her friend became pregnant. They worked in Counterintelligence Division while she joined Violent Crimes Unit under Criminal Investigative Division. Her friends died during an espionage plot, and their child has been missing since. It feels surreal. She couldn't even attend the funeral as their department took over the case, marking it top priority.

---

## VI. Roots (Katy's POV)

Katy tells Parthe she wants to learn about her parents. Parthe smiles and tells her about brave federal agents who died protecting their child. The child's profile and age fit Katy's exactly. Katy asks Strawberry for confirmation if she's the child in that case, and Strawberry nods.

---

## VII. Sun Diagnostics (Clara's POV)

Clara still stares at the Red Tiger board in her apartment. She recalls failing to profile Red Tiger, then searching for other cases in the vicinity of the NexBank heist. She found three interesting cases: a pet store heist, a Convocation Hall arsonist, and the Sun Diagnostics heist. She rereads the case file titled "Sun Diagnostics Heist." It feels too personal.

---

## VIII. Sun Herbal Shop (Katy's POV)

Strawberry tells the children about the thief's origin story. The thief broke into Sun Herbal Shop, which refused to help poor patients. The setting is masked in an ancient setting, but Parthe suspects it mirrors a case he found interesting: the Sun Diagnostics Heist.

---

## IX. Brother (Clara's POV)

Clara visits her brother's grave on a holiday. He died in a gang war. He was a drug addict, but he was all she had before her job. When she returns to her apartment, she reviews the board on her wall again. She searches for Red Tiger on porn sites. She tries to masturbate to one of the videos but fails to get aroused. She's too sad, missing her brother.

She passes out from exhaustion. She hears a knock on the door and opens it. It's Red Tiger. She's scared to let him in but eventually does. She doesn't understand why she finds his chest attractive. Without speaking a word, she finds herself connected to this man. She caresses his chest. He hugs her and puts her on the bed. She handcuffs his hands to the bed and has sex with him. At climax, she removes his mask and sees her brother's face. She climaxes while crying on her brother's chest.

---

## X. Connection (Katy's POV)

Katy is reading Tao Te Ching, the same one Strawberry received from her teacher. She tells Parthe how it aligns with evolution, how we're all connected. Parthe jokes that if everyone is connected, incest is just a normal relationship.

---

## XI. (Clara's POV)

Clara is ridiculed by her coworkers for not moving on from Red Tiger. One suggests tracking the money trail because money is always the target. Clara nods. She already tracked its trail years ago. She isn't convinced Red Tiger steals for money. Some heists are symbolic. Some are artistic. The Sun Diagnostics Heist is the only one that feels authentic. She searches her past emails, requesting redacted customer data from Sun Diagnostics and its parent company, Everwell Insurance. They refused to help the case.

---

## XII. (Katy's POV)

Katy explains metabolism to Parthe in sign language—how every life form needs energy input and output to process and live. Parthe turns it into an abstract thought experiment. Strawberries Home could be an organism, and they're the organs. He tells Katy about it. He wonders where the orphanage's funding comes from. Using a secure connection, he searches for donation ads but doesn't find convincing ones. They look too clean compared to messy real donation ads. Looking deeper, he realizes their home is virtually nonexistent.

---

## XIII. (Clara's POV)

By chance, Clara meets Strawberry at a bookstore named "Alexandria." Clara helps her carry the books. When they realize her car breaks down, Clara offers to drive her to Strawberries Home. There, Clara meets and bonds with Katy, who reminds her of her deceased colleagues. For the first time in years, Clara feels at home.

---

## XIV. (Katy's POV)

Strawberry tells the children about the heist of money-lenders. Katy sees Parthe researching NexBank. She thinks he's now intested in finance because of the bedtime story. [Parthe realizes it's a retelling of the NexBank Heist. Parthe connects Strawberry's stories to the Red Tiger legend, but keeps it to himself.]

---

## XV. (Clara's POV)

Clara realizes that Katy is about the same age as her friend's daughter. She passes out in the case files again. She hears a knock and finds Red Tiger at the door. She hugs him like a sad girl waiting for her lover. She kisses him through the mask, then removes it. She's not surprised to see Strawberry behind the mask this time. Strawberry kisses her back, and they have sex.

---

## XVI. (Katy's POV)

A girl named Art and a guy named Science visit Strawberries Home - Katy remembers them as guest teachers. Science looks at Tao Te Ching on Katy's desk and smiles at her. Strawberry asks him if he remembers how he used to demand rigor from the professor. Science smiles and nods. P runs to them when he sees them. They hug him and tell him he's growing so fast. Later they have a talk with Strawberry in private without teaching the children.

---

## XVII. (Clara's POV)

Clara meets Strawberry again at the bookstore. She has been visiting it in her leisure because it was mentioned in the Arsonist's case files. Clara casually asks her about Katy. She also asks if, by any chance, Strawberry knew the Arsonist. Strawberry answers that he was her professor. Clara says it's a shame—she's read some of his papers and knows he has a brilliant mind.

---

## XVIII. (Katy's POV)

Katy can't find Strawberry at Strawberries Home. She asks Parthe, and he tells her she's visiting her mentor again. Parthe is studying cryptography. He seems to recall something and tells her how to decode a media file in case he has to send her a secret message. She asks what the key phrase should be. He suggests "taoteching." Katy remembers something and opens the book. "We met in Alexandria" is written on the first page. Parthe smiles and nods.

---

## XIX. (Clara's POV)

Clara reads the Arsonist's case files again. She notices that there was a student named Seraphine Clair that was specially kind to the professor and quit school around the time of the case. They never got to interview her. She somehow feels like Seraphine matches the profile of Strawberry. She doesn't want to ask Strawberry if she's Seraphine; it'd be too invasive.

Clara takes fake IDs from her personal vault and goes to the prison to visit the arsonist. She's not sure if it's for collecting data on Red Tiger or her crush on Strawberry. She notices a name in the guest records: Strawberry Starling. She knows she's on the right track. She asks how he's doing. He politely tells her he's fine but bluntly continues that there's nothing more to investigate in his case. Clara agrees. She tells him she wants to know if there's anything he can remember about the Sun Diagnostics Heist, because it's one of three cases that still itch her mind. He says whoever stole from them is a good person. She asks about his relationship with his students. He says they can tolerate him. Clara nods, as it aligns with student interviews. She asks about his relationship with Seraphine. He replies she's a good person. She asks if she visited him recently. "Can't you ask for the guest records?" he replies and refuses to elaborate. But she sees a hint in his facial expression that confirms Seraphine is Strawberry.

---

## XX. (Katy's POV)

Katy and Parthe are playing with a ball in the woods. The ball is stuck on a tree. She climbs it to retrieve the ball. while she's getting down, she falls, and breaks her hand. Parthe runs to Strawberry, and she takes them to Atlas General Hospital. [I might change this to another injury that requires sending Katy to the hospital.]

---

## XXI. (Clara's POV)

Realizing she's fallen for Strawberry, Clara looks into her background as Seraphine. Why did she change her name to Strawberry Starling? She finds a funeral record of Seraphine's father. She suddenly realizes the time of his death is close to the Sun Diagnostics Heist. She goes to the hospital to look for his records. She learns Seraphine's father's insurance claim was denied by Everwell Insurance, of which Sun Diagnostics was a part. She knows it would be a stretch to suspect Strawberry (aka Seraphine) to be Red Tiger, but she thinks it has enough merit to investigate deeper.

---

## XXII. (Katy's POV)

Katy sees Clara at the hospital. Too busy with her own business, Clara doesn't notice her. Strawberry has trouble checking out at the hospital because they don't accept cash. She calls her friend, Poetry, to pay for the bills with her credit card.

---

## XXIII. (Clara's POV)

Clara notices all the paperwork around Strawberries Home is too perfect to be true. There's enough paperwork to justify everything. There are just enough donation requests for the funding, but they don't look like they're feeding on mercy. There's a sense of subtle pride. It would be rude to ask Strawberry directly about the orphanage's funding. She looks into the case files again and recalls Strawberry is fit enough to have the same build as Red Tiger. Everything points to Strawberry (aka Seraphine) being Red Tiger. Even real cases she's solved don't fit this well.

---

## XXIV. (Katy's POV)

Katy suddenly wants to know about the orphanage's finances. Parth—incapable of lying—reveals Strawberry's secret identity. Katy confronts Strawberry. She confesses: "I stole Eden back from God, knowing His wrath. It breaks my heart that I put you in harm's way." She tells the orphans the truth and gives them a choice to leave. Though hesitant, some choose to leave, but they all agree to protect her secret. Strawberry reveals Katy's parents are actually alive but unaware that Katy was rescued from kidnappers years ago by Politics (Parthe's father), who faked their death for their missions. Katy decides to reunite with them. As a parting gift, Strawberry gives Katy the Tao Te Ching.

---

## XXV. (Clara's POV)

Clara visits Strawberries Home. She only sees Parthe and a few other children. She asks Parthe about Katy and Strawberry. Parthe tells her Katy returned to her "resurrected" parents. He doesn't know where Strawberry is because she didn't tell him. Clara trusts him. She asks why she sees only a few children. Parthe answers it's because only a few children are in the orphanage. She clarifies her question: where did the other children go? Parthe answers they went to other orphanages. She's almost about to ask why but realizes it's too cruel to interrogate a child. She already knows Parthe knows Strawberry is Red Tiger. She can see it in his eyes. She also senses that he neither approves nor disapproves of Red Tiger, but he didn't leave Strawberries Home unlike Katy. She only tells him he must love Strawberry so much that he's here. Parthe nods. Clara asks if he can share where Katy lives now. Parthe shows her an email from Katy. She's doing great at her parents' home.

---

## XXVI. (Katy's POV)

Katy is doing well at home. She writes to Parthe asking how he's doing. Her parents come home after a late night at work, and she has dinner with them. After dinner, Katy receives an email from Parthe. He says everything is normal and he misses her. In the attachments are some cat memes. But she knows Parthe. He's not lying but he's not saying anything meaningful in the email body. She uses the key "airdnaxelanitemew"—the reverse of "wemetinalexandria"—to decode the images and finds a readable message in one image: "Clara visited us today. i shared your address with her. i found out she is a fed. she's been hunting Red Tiger for a decade. but i think she already knows Strawberry is Red Tiger but she doesn't do anything to hurt her. i believe she's safe for us. don't delete the email. if you're under watch, it'll attract unnecessary suspicion. may we all be kind." Katy sighs.

---

## XXVII. (Clara's POV)

On her way to visit Katy, Clara is urgently summoned to work to investigate a new case. The cryptocurrency from Nexance crypto exchange's cold wallets, kept in a 600-year-old bank facility's vault owned by NexBank, was stolen. She can imagine Strawberry breaking into the vault. It's her design. They ask if it's Red Tiger, and she admits she thinks so. She gives her email to the cyber forensics team to share results after X-ray analysis and accessing the hardware wallets.

When she gets home, she paranoidly searches for surveillance devices in her apartment. She finds none. She takes fake IDs hidden in her vault. She takes the stairs to avoid CCTV and exits the building. She uses different transportation methods to hide her tracks. When she's sure nobody is following her, she goes to the prison and shows fake IDs to access prison records. She removes all logs of Seraphine. She also hacks the prison network and deletes all logs of Seraphine—it's a legacy system that isn't well secured.

Then she uses different transportation again and goes to the hospital. She uses fake IDs to access physical records to erase Seraphine's father's records. But they're already erased. It takes her a while to hack the hospital network, but as expected, she finds no trace of Seraphine's father's records. She receives a text message: "Hi, I just saw you at the hospital. I'm Seraphine's friend. Parthe is my son. I took care of Seraphine's dad's records. I even erased your search history just now. Thank you for your kindness. Please stay safe. Love." Within 30 seconds, the message deletes itself.

---

## XXVIII. Code Red (Katy's POV)

Katy reads about the NexBank crypto heist. She receives an email from Parthe again. He tells her about Clara's visit in the email body this time. He asks if Clara has visited her yet. The tone is very innocent, as if he doesn't know Clara is the detective working on Red Tiger's last heist, as if he's unaware, as if he's a normal child. But Katy knows him. She decodes the images one by one and finds the message in one: "code red. your parents are investigating Clara. Clara is on our side but your parents aren't. please stay vigilant. may we all be kind." Katy tries to look normal and writes a letter under the blanket.

---

## XXIX. Violent Ends (Clara's POV)

Clara burns all the real clues that might reveal Strawberry's identity. She replaces them with unrelated real information. She also replaces her hard drives and destroys them. She takes a moment to check if she missed anything. When she's sure she did everything she could, she tries to relax and live normally. If she were under watch, the normal thing to do would be to visit Katy.

Clara visits Katy's home and is surprised to see her deceased colleagues as Katy's parents. They hug her and tell her they're happy to see her. She tells them she missed them so much. They talk about their lives. Katy's parents notice Clara isn't mentioning Red Tiger at all, even though there was a huge case in the news. They ask if she's given up on the tiger. Clara shakes her head. "Of course not. I'm sure I'll get her one day." Clara notices she slipped and said "her" instead of "him" but pretends to hide her anxiety. Katy's parents pretend not to notice, but Katy realizes Clara made the fatal mistake. Katy's mom excuses herself to go to the kitchen. Katy's dad keeps asking how she met Katy. Clara says it must be destiny because she's always loved Katy ever since she was born. Clara tells them she believes Katy will be able to talk again. Katy's mom brings tea for Katy and Clara. Katy refuses to drink it. Clara looks at them awkwardly. Katy says she wants to go to bed now.

They ask Clara to drink the tea, but she tries to refuse, suspecting it might be drugged. She makes an excuse to go home since she's too tired from working on Red Tiger's last heist. Katy's dad pulls his gun from a shelf and points it at Clara. Katy's mom asks her to calm down and share the information she has on Red Tiger. Clara shakily begs them to let her go at first, but realizes it's no use. She tells them she'll be interrogated willingly. Katy's dad tells her not to waste their time or he'll ask the task force to wipe out Strawberries Home, which Clara obviously cares about. Clara tells them they know Strawberries Home is innocent because it raised Katy. Katy's mom nods and says she knows. She tells Clara to give up on Red Tiger or innocent people will lose their lives. Clara runs toward Katy's dad and attacks him to take his gun. Katy's mom pulls out her gun and points it at Clara. Clara points the gun at Katy's dad. Clara says she still wants to believe they're her friends and drops the gun first. Katy's dad takes his gun back and points it at her. He then dials his phone to call his superior. "We have enough evidence to believe Clara knows something about Red Tiger. She's refusing to give us helpful information." He looks at Clara and tells her it's her last chance to give up on Red Tiger or he'll request authorization to storm Strawberries Home. Clara shakes her head and kneels. "Hand me to an interrogator." He warns for the last time: "Please give us anything helpful," then begins to speak into the phone. They are stunned as Katy attacks her mom with a pan from behind. Clara takes Katy's dad's gun again and points it at him. He sees pure anger in her eyes. He surrenders and speaks into the phone: "We've cornered her in my residence. Please arrange to contain her and interrogate her. It's good for now," and drops the phone. He asks her to drop the gun and surrender peacefully because the task force should have surrounded the home by now. She hesitates at first but begins to remove the bullets to drop the gun. But the task force storms into the home and starts shooting at her as she's holding their agents hostage. Clara hides under the table and shoots back. Katy jumps over her mom and runs toward Clara with a pan. Another team storms the house from behind. Amid the chaos, Katy's mom wakes up, groans, and crawls toward her daughter to protect her and her friend. But determined not to let Clara escape at any cost, all three of them, hugging each other, are gunned down by the task force.

## XXX. Epilogue (Strawberry's POV)

Strawberry is dressing for the funeral. She and Parthe attend Katy's funeral. Still unaware of Strawberry's identity, Katy's dad asks if they want Katy's possessions for other children. He keeps them in a box in his car. He doesn't know what to do with them, but it's too depressing to look at them. He apologizes to Strawberry if he sounded like he was blaming her for the deaths of Katy and Katy's mom. Strawberry assures him not to worry about it. Parthe grabs the box lovingly and takes out Tao Te Ching. He finds some hand signs on the front page under "We met in Alexandria." He quietly tells Strawberry that Katy wrote "Eden was worth it."

After the funeral, Parthe asks Strawberry the unbearable question: "Was the heist worth their lives?" Strawberry answers with only a silent headshake as she pulls him into a hug.
