# do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs [strawberries]

## I. VIOLENT DELIGHTS

Strawberries Home is a sanctuary for gifted children. "How do you know if a child is gifted?" you might ask. "All children are gifted," Strawberry would insist. It's an orphanage that raises its children on four pillars: Science (observation), Art (creation), Love (reflection), and Revolution (acceptance). K, a mute girl who loves nature, communicates through hand signs and Tao Te Ching annotations. P is the first orphan, destined to become a computational biologist because of K's influence. P would've been a Set Theorist if not for K. There is only one rule at Strawberries Home: "Thou shalt not lie."

## II. THE HEISTS FOR EDEN

The pink-obsessed girl S and Science drop out of university together. Science introduces her to Art, a singer at the bar "Guillotine". Their mission: to steal Eden back from God. Art and her friends plans four heists to fund the orphanage. The girl executes them wearing the Red Tiger mask, which becomes her infamous symbol. C, a genius detective assigned to hunt Red Tiger, grows tormented by the thief's perfection. When the heists stop, C's professional pursuit becomes a personal crusade.

## III. THE FINAL HEIST

Strawberry tells bedtime stories about Red Tiger's exploits - veiled as fairy tales like "The Thief Who Stole the Moon." Only P notices these stories mirror real events. With P's help, K learns two harsh truths: her parents (federal agents) died protecting her, and the orphanage's finances are collapsing. Science and Art, full of remorse and out of desperation, ask Strawberry for one final heist. She alone remains untraceable enough to attempt it.

## IV. THE DETECTIVE IN EDEN

By chance, C meets Strawberry at a bookstore named, "Alexandria". When Strawberry's car breaks down, C drives her to Strawberries Home. There, C bonds with K, who reminds her of deceased colleagues. For the first time in years, C feels at home. Through careful deduction during multiple visits, C slowly realizes Strawberry is Red Tiger - and finds herself falling for her.

## V. THE SERPENT

P connects Strawberry's stories to the Red Tiger legend. When K asks directly about the orphanage's finances, P - incapable of lying - reveals Strawberry's secret identity. K confronts Strawberry, who confesses: "I stole Eden back from God, knowing His wrath. It breaks my heart that I put you in harm's way." She tells the orphans the truth and gives them a choice to leave. Though hesitant, some choose to leave but they all agree to protect her secret. Strawberry reveals K's parents are actually alive but unaware that K was rescued from the kidnappers years ago by Love (P's father) faked their death for their missions. K decides to reunite with them. As parting gift, Strawberry gives K the beer-stained Tao Te Ching from alexandria.

## VI. VIOLENT ENDS

When C returns, she finds K gone and the orphanage half-empty. P explains K has reunited with her "resurrected" parents - C's former coworkers, who now distrust anyone connected to Red Tiger, including C herself. During what should be an innocent visit, C sits with K's family for tea, unaware her parents are monitoring them. C slips: "I've hunted 'her' for decades." K's parents immediately understand - C has more information on Red Tiger than she reported. They drag C away, threatening to kill P and Strawberry unless she gives up the information on Red Tiger. K attacks her own parents to protect them. In the chaos, federal agents that were alerted gun down both K and C.

Still unaware of Strawberry's identity, K's parents deliver her possessions to Strawberries Home. Inside the Tao Te Ching, they find a letter: "Eden was worth it."

At the funeral, P asks Strawberry the unbearable question: "Was the heist worth their lives?" Strawberry answers with only a silent headshake as she pulls him into a hug.
