I've been writing 4 novels since I was 21. I'm 27 now. it's just one at first and then i got another idea and so on. now I have 4 summaries for 4 novels.

the titles are

"we met in alexandria" [alexandria]
"do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs" [strawberries]
"(let me kiss you) at the funeral of the gods" [funogods]
"til the end of the world" [drifters]


Galvarino

the plots are pretty much confirmed. please don't guess the plot yet. I will share the outlines one by one. I've written some drafts but it's far from finished since I've been working a different full time job. so I drafted the outlines first and I'm currently working on the third. I want you to act like a friend listening to my pitch first. and then as a stranger that reads my novel.

 I want to check if there's any inconsistency, if the twists are too obvious or too subtle.

this is the first novel's outline. you'll see each chapter has two titles; mundane one and the greek myth inspired one in the quotes. like the ceiling fan and tartarus.
