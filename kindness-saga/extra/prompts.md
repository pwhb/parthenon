I've been writing 4 novels since I was 21. I'm 27 now. it's just one at first and then i got another idea and so on. now I have 4 summaries for 4 novels.

the titles are

"we met in alexandria" [alexandria]
"do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs" [strawberries]
"(let me kiss you) at the funeral of the gods" [funogods]
"til the end of the world" [drifters]

Galvarino

the plots are pretty much confirmed. please don't guess the plot yet. I will share the outlines one by one. I've written some drafts but it's far from finished since I've been working a different full time job. so I drafted the outlines first and I'm currently working on the third. I want you to act like a friend listening to my pitch first. and then as a stranger that reads my novel.

 I want to check if there's any inconsistency, if the twists are too obvious or too subtle.

this is the first novel's outline. you'll see each chapter has two titles; mundane one and the greek myth inspired one in the quotes. like the ceiling fan and tartarus.

Camus isn't a philosopher I personally like. I find his philosphy coming from a privileged background and diluted. not that I'm saying his work isn't accurate. I just find other philosophers more precise. I was watching Chomsky-Foucault Debate and suddenly realized my protagonist mirrors Foucault a lot. Not just the critique but psychiatry screams Foucault more than other philosophers.

I'm writing a novel. I'm writing it in English since it's set in a global setting. English isn't my native language so there might be sentences I failed to make smooth and natural. Can you check them and help me with smoothening them? it's ok if you think what I wrote it ok too. Please try to act like a casual reader. You don't need to look too hard.

I know there are a lot of places to be improved. but I honestly don't know how to improve it. since I saved my version in git commit, you can provide your corrected version and I'll check the changes and ask you back if i don't agree with some changes.

I'm writing a novel. I'm writing it in English since it's set in a global setting. English isn't my native language so there might be sentences I failed to make smooth and natural. Can you check them and help me with smoothening them? I added (smooth) tag for the chapters I already refined enough; they are meanted to be a reference for what I'm aiming for. I added (raw) tag for the chapters I haven't.

It's ok if you think what I wrote is ok so far. Please try to act like a casual reader. You don't need to look too hard.

What I shared below is the first two chapters I'm satisfied with for now. It's only as a reference for what I'm aiming for in the next chapters.

my goal is to introduce four protagonists in four chapters. I understand since they all share the same spirit of understanding the world deeply and a similar fate, there's a risk of kind of getting repeatitive or duplicate. did I do I good job of introducing four unique characters? then in the next three chapters, I give the backstory for the four except for Love whose story was already self-contained in the introduction. I know, again, there's a risk of the backstories being similar to each other or even unbalanced. but is the narrative I chose so far convincing and organic?

my novel is centered around four protagonists. each represents a unique mode of understanding. the story is told in alternating POVs of four protagonists. I hope you can see the tone and theme of each.

can we work on refining these paragraphs? feel free to suggest paragraph by paragraph edit where I can improve, add more details. I'd prefer to keep my original tone though. some mysteries are intentionally left ambiguous to emphasize the character development in emotional dimension first.

In that moment, I wasn't just offering comfort. I was creating a bridge between two souls, that knew the same despair.

"Do I know you?" she asked, trying to recall her childhood despite her heavy emotions in the present.

With a glance at the files on her lap, I noticed the name Arthur Clair. I understood her father was a patient here.

"Ah, sorry. My name is Leila Lysandra. I'm David Lysandra's daughter," I explained. "You're Arthur's daughter, right?" She nodded.

"I heard David adopted a daughter but I can't remember if I met her," she said, agreeing with my explanation.

"I don't think you met me properly. My dad took me along when he met his friend, Arthur. It was soon after I arrived Atlas City. Maybe fifteen years ago. I saw you working out in the playground from a distance. I remembered Arthur said you were his daughter, Seraphine" I went on. She seemed convinced.

"I'm sorry about your dad," I said softly, "Please let me know if there's anything I can do for you."

"Thank you. You just did a lot already. Your hug took half my distress," she replied with a faint smile.

"Can I take a look at the files?" I asked, thinking it might be painful for her to explain her father's condition herself. She nodded and handed me the files. I opened the files gently. He was suffering from a heart condition, namely, Coronary Artery Disease. It seemed he was in a terminal condition. Assuming Seraphine was also a final year student, I calculated he might not even see her graduate. It would explain her sorrow. What was with her guilt and hesitation? Coronary Artery Bypass Graft surgery would be the only option left for him.

"Did you schedule a surgery?" I asked, hoping I could offer some help.

She shook her head. It was insensitive of me. I blamed myself. Of course, without health insurance, the surgery cost might be too much for a struggling family of a retired professor.

"I hope the insurrance claim would be approved soon," she muttered. I wished with all heart, it would be approved soon. It would explain her overwhelming emotions of guilt and hesitation.

"Please let me know if I could do something to accelerate the process, Sera." I promised to help. She nodded. I wanted to offer financial support if she needed but I thought better of it. It would be more appropriate if my dad talked to her; her was her dad's friend after all.

before the protagonists converge in Atlas City, I think it's better to make Strategist and Alchemist share a place in somewhere near Altaria. They have been travelling around Europe with the magic crew for six years. Now they have been uncovering the conspiracies behind Strategist's parents' death. I think I need to show Strategist breaking into home network of the Cassian Faust before they break into his residence in Atlas City. what would be the best location for this one-time chapter?

Since we change Financier to Cowardice and Billionaire to Debt. I need Financier's name to be something that starts with C (represeting Cowardice) and Billionaire's to be something that starts with D (representing Debt). I think it's ok to keep their race the same. Financier has Germanic/Scandinavian origin while the billionaire has some developed country origin but end up in US. Also I think Streaming Platform CVO (representing Temptation) to have a French origin. is Tatiana Vance as a French name ok? if not, please suggest a name that starts with T for her too.

I'm writing a novel. I'm writing it in English since it's set in a global setting. But English isn't my native language. I added (smooth) tag for the chapters I already refined enough; they are meant to be a reference for what I'm aiming for. I added (raw) tag for the chapters I haven't. But for this chat, I just want to discuss about my new chapter instead of revising the previous chapters. let me share some related chapters so you have a strong context of the tone and depth I'm aiming for.

there are four protagonists whose POV is alternating in each chapter. the first four chapters introduce them but I'll only share the chapters of the protagonists that will be in the new chapter.

is the content in the draft plausible so far? Polis and Art are 23 years old by then. the time is about 2013. we need to check on both sides,

1) the group of the adversaries are the most powerful people controlling the world in the shadows
2) the protagonists established they had extraordinary talent for certain things

party 1 would of course have advanced security protocols for their operations and I don't want to just add fancy spy work into my novel. I want something grounded yet plausible for my grand vision. what we need to check specially is whether the weak points of party 1 that party 2 exploited are plausible and realistic.

so I introduced the financier as a part of world building. I think his character is realistic so far but please help me check it too. and I mentioned that he was in prison so his clients would need his successor to handle their secret transaction and shady jobs. it is the core of this chapter. the event in MesseTurm is where his successor will be crowned.

I sketched my plot to go like this the protagonists will place microphones and pineapple or some devices in the penthouse without being detected. and they'll learn three things from the intelligence they gathered.

1) the identity of the successor (I think it's plausible when enough microphones are placed in the room)
2) confirmed location of one of his safety deposit (I think it's plausible when the successor show the clients the proof that he had access to the confidential information the original financier left for him and only him)
3) some details about his smart home system (perhaps when he check his home security via a compromised network the protagonists setup, when the protagonists triggered some paranoia in him [I'd have to come up with the details for that part later.])

is the requirement of the chapter plausible?
