I've been writing 4 novels since I was 21. I'm 27 now. it's just one at first and then i got another idea and so on. now I have 4 summaries for 4 novels.

the titles are

"we met in alexandria" [alexandria]
"do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs" [strawberries]
"(let me kiss you) at the funeral of the gods" [funogods]
"til the end of the world" [drifters]

Galvarino

the plots are pretty much confirmed. please don't guess the plot yet. I will share the outlines one by one. I've written some drafts but it's far from finished since I've been working a different full time job. so I drafted the outlines first and I'm currently working on the third. I want you to act like a friend listening to my pitch first. and then as a stranger that reads my novel.

 I want to check if there's any inconsistency, if the twists are too obvious or too subtle.

this is the first novel's outline. you'll see each chapter has two titles; mundane one and the greek myth inspired one in the quotes. like the ceiling fan and tartarus.

Camus isn't a philosopher I personally like. I find his philosphy coming from a privileged background and diluted. not that I'm saying his work isn't accurate. I just find other philosophers more precise. I was watching Chomsky-Foucault Debate and suddenly realized my protagonist mirrors Foucault a lot. Not just the critique but psychiatry screams Foucault more than other philosophers.

I'm writing a novel. I'm writing it in English since it's set in a global setting. English isn't my native language so there might be sentences I failed to make smooth and natural. Can you check them and help me with smoothening them? it's ok if you think what I wrote it ok too. Please try to act like a casual reader. You don't need to look too hard.

I know there are a lot of places to be improved. but I honestly don't know how to improve it. since I saved my version in git commit, you can provide your corrected version and I'll check the changes and ask you back if i don't agree with some changes.

I'm writing a novel. I'm writing it in English since it's set in a global setting. English isn't my native language so there might be sentences I failed to make smooth and natural. Can you check them and help me with smoothening them? I added (smooth) tag for the chapters I already refined enough; they are meanted to be a reference for what I'm aiming for. I added (raw) tag for the chapters I haven't.

It's ok if you think what I wrote is ok so far. Please try to act like a casual reader. You don't need to look too hard.

What I shared below is the first two chapters I'm satisfied with for now. It's only as a reference for what I'm aiming for in the next chapters.
