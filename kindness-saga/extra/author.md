I've been writing 4 novels since I was 21. it's just one at first and then i got another idea and so on. now I have 4 summaries for 4 novels.

the titles are

"we met in alexandria" [alexandria]
"do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs" [strawberries]
"(let me kiss you) at the funeral of the gods" [funogods]
"til the end of the world" [drifters]

the plots are pretty much confirmed. please don't guess the plot yet. I will share the outlines one by one.

I'm 27 now. I started writing stories, poems and jokes since I was 12. I stopped writing from 15 to 21 because my dad didn't understand privacy and read my diary and the stories that I hid. I felt violated. I restarted writing at 21 while studying maths at the university. I've been working as a software developer since I was 23. I graduated with maths. maths has always been more like a religion to me than a subject. I used to believe maths is the universal answer that can explain everything until I realize maths isn't enough. I mean it's the language of all the gods and the universe but it's not enough. even its broader applications that we can generally call science isn't enough. because art is another answer. science might be able to take us to the ideal world but art can help us live in the flawed world. eventually I realized that science and art aren't enough to explain something like love. even though love can explain almost everything, just like science and art, love isn't enough. eventually I found Badiou's four truths. science, art, politics and love. I think they're the same as the answer or the theory of everything I've been searching for so to speak. and then I found daoism. I was raised by theravada buddhist parents and I became an atheist at like 15. now I believe faith is important and I'm a daoist that has faith in kindness.

I've tried to quit school multiple times. my resignation was rejected every time. I spent years drowning in alcohol, struggling with crippling depression and anxiety. the dropout and the professor are the two polar version of me that I failed to be. who I could be. another dream of mine is to take care of children because I believe I can do a better job of parenting than anyone I met. I also had a mentor; she taught me curiosity and everything I needed to become a scientist.
