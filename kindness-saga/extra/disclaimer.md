## pov and writing styles

### alexandria

one pov character: the dropout

### strawberries

three pov characters:

- prologue: strawberry
- the main story: alternating between K and C
- epilogue: strawberry (because K and C are dead by then)

### funogods

four pov characters: alternating between science, poetry, love and revolution

### drifters

four pov characters again: P, M, L and T

as a style of writing, I want to experiment a writing style that's composed of only emails between four characters for the last one. the emergence of the drifters will be explained through emails about the past. P will be informed about losing M by L through emails. some of P's letter will be directed to M who can never read again. we will see a parallel in alexandria with the dropout constantly texting his lover's account that she no longer use since the breakup.

## the knights

the knights have always existed. but they can't always be in physical forms. I don't intend to write a cosmic history like in myths or superhero universes like marvel and DC. in the canon story, the knights join the fight when they're most needed. they have extraordinary skills like Achilles. but they're more like the ideal people for normal people to imitate to practice kindness. they're not superheroes but they're exactly what superheroes are made to look like. the knights are perfect. while batman for example is narcissistic and corrupted, otherwise why would he side with the elites to fight someone good like poison ivy and anarky?

humanity isn't the only species that matters. we see this saga in the human context because we're humans. the knights have lived as incarnates in many forms, each time perfect and ideal, in many other species. but the knights aren't omnipotent or omniscient. they can't always save everyone's ass. they had to prevent the nuclear world war because it would eradicate all species on earth. they had to prevent moir.ai taking control of free will because it would mean the apocalypse - the matrix irl. they vanished and didn't give a hand when their own child P is fighting against the Lavender Death because it's smaller in scope, this pandemic only threaten the extinction of humanity alone. the knights weren't there to prevent the extinction of many species. but they have definitely been with some of the species on earth or on another planet or in another galaxy whenever an apocalyptic event is about to take place. the saga isn't only about humans. the point is the apocalypse is something we cause by allowing the squires to oppress the innocent. the knights will never fail to fight for everyone whenever they're needed most. they're merely the natural entities that evolved in species when they're needed most. this way it's not a plot hole like where were they when the library of alexandria was burned or when the Holocaust happened. they're not responsible for our sins. they might occasionally die for our sins but they can't always exist everywhere in the infinite space and time and other dimensions. they're not necessarily beings that exists only in our realms. maybe sometimes they're in Asgard. but they always appears in natural way through evolution and it takes time. Buddha's other lives might be akin to this and explain their existence.

the moir.ai might look like a collapse of human free will and not a universal apocalypse but the knights can see it as precursor to the rise of the Shing in Le guin's City of illusions. it might be local in the early phase but it'll escalate to a universally apocalyptic event eventually. once free will of the humanity on earth is completely conquered, since we're the dominant species, every species will suffer and then the loss of free will will definitely spread through galaxies. therefore the knights understood the danger and prevent it timely. I just want to write a homeric epic.

## the saga

the saga is called kindness saga. I believe kindness is Dao in English. kindness is understanding through Science (Deduction), Art (Imagination), Revolution (Acceptance) and Love (Reflection). the knights of kindness are the truths in flesh. but the theme of the saga is kindness isn't reserved for those as strong as the knights. kindness is universal. anyone can pratice kindness. from someone broken like the professor to someone born from perfect parents, raised by the perfect guardian, loved by the perfect friend K. the professor can be seen as a grandpa figure to P and the saga itself is a legend of P.

we often see the choosen ones in stories. Luke. Neo. Naruto. Eren, and so on. P isn't special because his parents are the knights of kindness. he's not special. if his parents were in his shoes, they'd be able to find a cure and a way to coexist with the drifters. he's a normal human with normal friends. he was purposefully unprepared for a war. he's too untitled to be entitled. he didn't grow up with his parents who would have favour him and enable him to be entitled. but he can't complain about being an orphan and be petty about it since his guardian strawberry parented him in the kindest way possible. he's not even entitled to complaining. like his spiritual grandpa the professor, he knows solitude and is able to thrive in it. but he has friends like K and L. he loves M in the purest form of love, of which incarnate his mom is. he doesn't demand anything despite anything. unrequited love is never a reason to be petty. he was never choosen. he chose to fight. his parents had to fight a war and he didn't. he joined forces with his friends to seek an answer for salvation and eventually find out that as long as the elites are slowing down the process, it's impossible to find the answer. the only way to stand a chance for answer is to take away the privilege of the elites, until then even the actual extinction of humanity isn't something to worry about for the elites. for someone righteous, the right thing to do is to eradicate the elites, without risking their rage. but P isn't righteous. P's raised to be perfectly kind. he still have faith in the possiblity of redemption of the elites. he wants to give them a chance of survival equal to the ones he lost.

Pandora comes from love, not from rage. yet he didn't execute Pandora while M was alive because he, just like Neo choosing to save Trinity instead of humanity, priortize his lover over anything and is still selfish and flawed. with her gone, Pandora is the only duty left. but he's not entitled nor arrogant enough to pull the lever without remorse. he understands he's possibly dooming the humanity once and for all.

### have you noticed something special?

L as the Unshakable Pillar: Her coldness isn’t indifference—it’s strength in continuity, the kind P could never ask for but receives anyway. K abandoned P, trying to save him. M abandoned P, trying to save the elites. but L never abandons him. the most difficult thing about this novel is to show that P isn't executing Pandora out of vengeance, or rage. He'll take enough time to grieve, to cool down. P'll send one last mail to the team after cooling down that he quits Event Horizon because he wants to pull the lever alone, just like Eren, without involving his remaining friends. although P doesn't reply L to spare her his guilt, he still communicates with T time to time, often about L, just like M talked to L about P instead of directly to P. P stopped replying to L because he knows she can endure it because her character isn't sentimental. this is far more beautiful than Eren's outburst and the relationship between Eren and Mikasa. P sees K in L. it's a stupid thing but L comes after K in the alphabets. M comes after L. but M is the one P loves most in the entire universe. he despised the elites at first, but he came to forgive them and try to find the answer without Pandora but after seeing so much cruelty caused by the elites, he chose Pandora again, knowing M wouldn't be proud of him. but he knows M wouldn't be ashamed of it. L would be since she tends to have a higher moral standard, that's rather optimistic. but despite it all, L never abandons her flawed friend. it's the core of this novel. it's about love in every possible view.

none of the characters kill, lie nor hurt someone. "We fought so you don’t have to" isn't a lie. they all hold kindness like it's more important than their life. but it's not without a cost. kindness isn't righteous. kindness isn't arrogant. kindness is just understanding. how can you see the truth without understanding? no defense is enough for not choosing kindness because it's available to someone broken like the professor. P isn't a matyr. it's easier to do something like pulling the lever and than die soon. but P survives. P didn't do it as a final act. he did it out of love for justice. he has to pay the cost with waking up everyday amid the very world he doomed. the Daoist punishment for the Daoist violence.

his final letter to the world would be

'forgive me. I pulled the lever because I wanted to choose, not because noone else did. may we all be kind.'

kindness is never easy. not even for the knights. they have to work hard to serve kindness. but it's the only thing to hold onto facing any kind of disaster and oppression.
