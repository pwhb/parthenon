# "(let me kiss you) at the funeral of the gods"

There have always been Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse—and Four Knights of Kindness to oppose them: Science, Art, Love, Revolution. Their prophets once walked among mortals—Euler, Van Gogh, Kierkegaard, Diogenes—but now, the knights are born as flesh. So are the squires of the horsemen. Each horseman has squires.

Four humans children were born as ordinary children. Each of them found the truth they represent. One day they find each other and understand they have a duty to serve together.

## I. THE PROFESSOR’S FALL

Science points out to help the Professor understand his fight against oppression: Conquest wears three faces—Quantification, Dishonesty, Subjugation. "It’s not humiliation," he insists. S, the pink-obsessed girl from his lectures, doesn’t understand—but she defends him anyway.

Then Revolution arrives. Pregnant with Love’s child, she corners S in the library:
"Raise my child."
"Why me?"
"You’ll see."

Revolution has a gift: she makes people accept their truest selves. S submits her resignation letter approved by the Professor—just before he bombs the convocation hall, destroying student records and exam papers. "Let them see the system in flames," he says.

The state brands him a terrorist. The Director of Feds (Bureaucracy, Famine’s squire) ensures his life sentence. The Editor-in-Chief of State Media (Silence, Death’s squire) broadcasts his fall.

## II. THE HEISTS FOR EDEN

At the Guillotine bar, S confesses her dream to Science: an orphanage named Strawberries Home. "If only I had funding," she sighs.
Science smirks: "Don’t worry about it." Art, the singer, slides beside them after singing "Bella Ciao" and unfolds a plan: four heists to fund Eden.

S hesitates. What if the crimes trace back to the orphans? But Science proves Art’s plans flawless. With the knights’ help, S becomes Red Tiger:

Science infiltrates a vault of world bank. (target: Debt, Famine’s squire).

Revolution raids the Moir.ai HR Manager mansion. (Subjugation, Conquest’s squire).

Love strikes the PM’s residence (Propaganda, War’s squire) and the General’s compound (Submission, War’s squire).

Eden is stolen back from God.

## III. THE WAR

For years, the knights wage their shadow war on two fronts:
Love infiltrates the secret service as a consultant, while Art plays violin at elite balls—gathering intelligence to prevent Nuclear World War.
Science and Revolution hide themselves within Moir.ai, posing as researchers to investigate the data fueling the war machine.
During a mission, Love uncovers a plot: the coercion of foreign federal agents (K’s parents) through the kidnapping of their child. He intervenes, spiriting K away to Strawberries Home, where his own son, P, lives.

The knights’ rendezvous point is Oblivion Museum, its curator (Oblivion, Death’s squire) meticulously erasing genocides from exhibits. Art notices the pattern—history rewritten in real time—and they realize the curator serves the Horsemen. Yet, because Moir.ai’s executives remain oblivious to the knights’ discussions, they assume the curator is merely a silent witness.

## IV. THE POINT OF NO RETURN

While distracted by preventing the World War, Revolution and Science make a horrifying discovery:
Moir.ai’s predictions now hit 97% accuracy for individual fates because not only it predicts human desire but also manipulate to imprison free will.
The system is one update away from erasing free will entirely.
Art and Love respond by organizing clandestine protests, but the squires retaliate ruthlessly:
The Director of Feds (Bureaucracy, Famine's squire) deploys riot units.
The Prime Minister (Propaganda, War's squire) spins the narrative.
The Editor-in-Chief (Silence, Death's squire) censors dissent.
The celebrity (Dishonesty, Conquest's squire) distract the people and General (Submission, War's squire) violently break up the movement.
When Moir.ai exposes Revolution and Science’s true intentions, they’re terminated on the spot by the HR Manager (Subjugation, Conquest’s squire). With no options left, they turn to Strawberry—now a ghost in the system, the only one untraceable enough to strike back.

## V. THE FINAL GAMBIT

Four knights design a near-flawless plan: infiltrate Moir.ai’s data center inside the secure building under the world bank—the sole access point to its infrastructure, which Strawberry had already breached years prior.

Love, posing as a psychiatrist, extracts intel from the world bank president's assistant.
Art, performing at the CTO’s gala, maps his security protocols.
With hesitation, Science and Art ask Strawberry to execute the impossible.
Science recognizes the professor's Tao Te Ching at Strawberries Home.

## IV. THE FINAL HEIST

Strawberry executes the world bank heist, stealing funds to sustain Strawberries Home for a century. But her true mission is deeper:
She plants a backdoor in Moir.ai’s servers.
Erases all digital traces (logs, security footage).
Leaves no physical evidence.
The Director of Feds (Bureaucracy, Famine's squire) alerts Moir.ai’s CEO (Cowardice, War's squire) — despite finding no proof of intrusion. The paranoid CTO (Quantification, Conquest’s squire) suspects the truth. For three days, he scours systems until he finds a phantom network blip—just enough to declare war.
Global manhunt begins.
An emergency stand-down stops Moir.ai's maintenance entirely.
All sysadmins locked out; users suffer glitches.
Monitoring teams find nothing, because Revolution and Science lie low, warned by hacked federal emails (courtesy of Love/Art’s social engineering).

After ten days of forced inactivity, the system stabilizes and the hacked emails reveal the stand-down order has been lifted. Revolution and Science make their move - accessing the network through Strawberry's backdoor, its signature deliberately mismatched from the whitelisted MAC addresses and IP ranges of Moir.ai's new secret sysadmins.
The CTO's trap springs shut the moment they connect.
What follows is a brutal, microscopic war fought in the network:
The CTO's security protocols attempt to immediately lock them out
Their counterattack leverages the script-generated credentials and penetration toolkit prepared during the stand-down
They hijack authenticated user sessions as pivot points
The knights deploy a cascade of decryption keys like sonic mines

The CTO watches in real-time as they exfiltrate Moir.ai's core model. When he realizes they're seconds from capturing the proprietary prediction algorithms, he makes the call that will haunt him - contacting the Director of Feds to escalate from digital to physical containment.

The tactical raid achieves its objective at terrible cost. K and C die in the crossfire, their blood soaking the floor of Strawberries Home as the remaining children are evacuated to underground bunkers. Yet even as the knights mourn, their war continues - now fought from shadows within shadows.

## V. THE LAST STAND

Art and Love reverse-engineer Moir.ai, rewriting its destiny-algorithm in churches and support groups. Science and Revolution, aided by blackhat networks, codify the tweaks.

The knights’ final mission: infiltrate the CTO’s fortress—the only place with source-code access. They know escape is impossible.

Inside, they:

Upload the new code.
Updating the new patch, they have a conversation with the Moir.ai during the confirmation step.
"The perfect world is so close. The world without crimes. The world without suffering. Are you sure you want to push this chaotic patch, at the cost of suffering?"
"Let there be suffering."
Erase all traces.
Hide within the fortress as the CTO and global law enforcement hunt them in vain.
Their last act is self-erasure. (They kill themselves and execute a self-destroy mechanism to destroy their own bodies because they're ordinary humans.)

## VI. AFTERMATH

Moir.ai’s predictions plummet to 47% accuracy.
Users rejoice at the "improved" AI.
Stocks surge 400%.
The CEO/CTO seethe, blind to the hack. The CTO can't revert the patch because they can't risk losing users. It's impossible to reverse-engineer the new patch because the chaotic humanity is embedded in it.
The billionaire CEO (Cowardice, War’s squire) pivots to deep-sea lithium mining—another kind of theft.
In a bunker, P clutches the beer-stained Tao Te Ching from alexandria.
On the table is a letter from his parents:
"Forgive us. We must steal free will back from the false gods."
