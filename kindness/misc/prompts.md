please note to not overstep in the creative area; please avoid suggesting cliche scenes as an example. you can suggest a vague idea though. please act like a friend listening to my pitch.

I've been writing 4 novels for 6 years. it's just one at first and then i got another idea and so on. now I have 4 summaries for 4 novels.

the titles are

"we met in alexandria" [alexandria]
"do strawberries dream of sweetest (saddest) songs" [strawberries]
"(let me kiss you) at the funeral of the gods" [funogods]
"til the end of the world" [drifters]

the plots are pretty much confirmed. please don't guess the plot yet. I will share the outlines one by one.

---

I need help with the character names. I'll share the character map later. for now just so you know the plots let me share the outline

---

each section is more like an arc than a chapter. each arc takes multiple chapters. I swear the actual novels are deeper and have more details that I can't possibly express in the outline.

---

the novels are deeply connected but each story should be self-contained and also work as a standalone. the connections, and those that will be easter eggs should reward rereading and the novels should be available to be read in another order, each of 4! ways should give a different flavour.

---

there's no T in strawberries. no, the knights didn't cause the Lavender Death but the billionaire CEO (Cowardice) pivoted to lithium mining since he can't control the world through Moir.ai.

let me share the disclaimer file to clarify things you might be confused.

the squires serve the horsemen and the horsemen in turn serve the apocalypse because the squires are never ambitious enough to serve the apocalypse directly. yes all the squires are entitled fascists but they're not ambitious. no matter how harmful they're, they don't understand they can bring apocalypse alone. in drifters, the Lavender Death is brought by Cowardice alone. the general and prime minister escalated the situation with bombing the innocent and walls and genocide but once the entitled CEO pivoted to Lithium mining, the end of the world was already confirmed. it's just an example. there are many instances where a representation of the squires brought us to the point of no return and it's exactly why we're living in a dystopian world that we can't break out. while the knights are never entitled, they're ambitious. they aim to strike fate and steal free will no matter how powerless they and their allies are. I want to make it clear that being ambitious and being entitled are completely different.
