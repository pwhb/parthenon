my friend speaks in songs

we speak in songs,
more like you speak in songs, 
and I listen to you,
for i'm not fluent in songs.

in songs we smile;
in songs we cry;
in songs we care;
in songs we share;
in songs we live;
in songs we suffer.

songs and stories,
dreams and fantasies,
butterflies and flowers,
colors and imageries.

how did you know i always wanted to learn songs?
not like music theory but just songs -
that i longed to live through.

you didn't just send songs to me;
you sent me to -
the worlds i didn't know i lived in,
the memories i didn't know i experienced,
the journeys i didn't remember i made,
the feelings i failed to express.

why invent a time machine
when we already have songs
why build a space ship
when we already have songs

thank you for making me fall in love with life (again)

panic and tears
fear and sadness

songs and stories,
dreams and fantasies.

memories and diary
raindrops and sea
