# The Art of the Deal

Chilling is the temperature of capitalism. It wasn't with a heavy heart that I pushed the door opened. The meeting room was empty except for the head of my office. If soullessness had a smell, it had to be the smell of meeting rooms. Not the slaughterhouse where the smell was mixed with pain of the slaughtered, fragments of the souls, that the slaughterman pretended not to notice.

"Take a seat Parthe."

He didn't look me in the eyes. He didn't have the courage to. I sensed the contempt he had for me in his eyes that couldn't face mine anyway. I tried to be easy on him by not looking into his eyes even though he didn't deserve it.

"I heard you've been spreading rumors that ... our company ... this company isn't in a good shape."

I'd been telling everyone how oppressive this company was even though the middle management did their best to sell the lie that it was a friendly environment that was worth investing your time. It wasn't an easy thing to do on both sides. How do you tell others that you all are sinking in the mud when you can't do anything because you all are sinking in the mud?

"It wasn't me. I know this company is thriving no matter how hard you try to hide it. I know this company is thriving because I'm an integral part of this machine. You made up that message about declining revenues to convince the workers that they couldn't possibly get what they deserve."

Too much pressure was contained between his eyebrows that they could explode. Wouldn't it be a sight? Would cruelty or shamelessness would paint the world if his head exploded?

"So they were right all along. You hated the company. I wanted to ignore it as long as you're doing your job right."

"I'm doing my job right."

"Where in your responsibility is to lie to other people that we're incompetent?"

"But you're very competent and I never said a lie. I never said you weren't competent. You put so much efforts in selling your lies. I have to give you that. You were just so arrogant that you expected your lies to work even if they made no sense."

He sighed. We both knew confrontation wouldn't be breezy.

"So you confess you hate your job and you want to take us down?"

"I don't deny it. Whoever clueless manager that informed you didn't understand how hard I had to try to deliver my message."

"It wasn't one. A couple of trusted colleagues let me know that you hated this company."

"You mean the professional liars that you outsourced your job of lying the real workers. How do you trust the people whose job you knowing is lying?"

"I don't understand where your anger is rooted in. You've been with us for a long time. I don't want to fight with you."

"Me neither."

"What do you want?"

"I want to be happy."

"Are you happy that you're jeopardizing the structure of the company that you helped built?"

"No. I don't enjoy doing it."

"Then why do you do it?"

I wished he was looking into my eyes. No words could explain to him better than the contempt in my eyes did.

"You made me do it. I tolerated my boring job for more than four years without complaining. I wish it was never necessary to reveal your lies."
